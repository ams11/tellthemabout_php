Apparently the nut that held on the muffler had fallen off and the bolt was busy being worn down to nothing.  After a bit of poking and 5 Rs., we had a new bolt and a quieter rickshaw for our  drive to The Poor Man&acirc;??s Taj Mahal.  It&acirc;??s got the big dome, four towers, and looks cute and manageable.  It was nice going early in the morning so that we had the place mostly to ourselves. Next we headed for  Ajanta, one of two sites in India famous for their cave temples carved into the cliffside (the other is Ellora, but it was closed Tuesdays).  They charged for parking the rickshaw, walking through the tourist shops to the shuttle bus, the shuttle bus to the caves, bag check, admission, the bathroom, and the bus back to the parking lot.  But despite all that it was totally worth it.  Lonely Planet can give you the full rundown on the history of the cave and the artwork they contain, we&acirc;??ll just stick with saying whatever the history is &acirc;?? Buddhist, Hindu, Jainist &acirc;?? they look very impressive! Some highlights &acirc;?? a huge reclining Buddha, a bunch of &acirc;??spider&acirc;?? Buddhas in one of the temples holding up the ceiling, and two story caves&acirc;?&brvbar;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the caves, we came to what, I suppose, was an inevitable decision point: do we go to Agra or not? The original plans, had us going to Agra simply because you really can&acirc;??t go to India and not see the Taj Mahal! Then we got to Kochi, talked to everybody else, heard over half were going directly East, and how long they thought the drive was going to take&acirc;?&brvbar; and figured we had to skip Agra in order to stick within our timeline. Wildly guessing on a map, Ajanta is 1100 km from Varanasi directly and 1400 km via Agra, so for the price of one extra day driving we get to see the Taj Mahal Friday!   Two hours of driving in, Lonely Planet brings an enlightening discovery: the Taj Mahal is actually closed on Fridays. (Side Note: why in the world is the Taj Mahal, the greatest tourist attraction in all of India, closed? Ever?) Another brief conversation on the side of the road later, and we&acirc;??re going anyway &acirc;?? we can just spend Friday in Agra, see the Taj Mahal at sunrise on Saturday and still leave for Varinasi before noon, which could get us there in time to spend most of Monday there (with some good fortune in terms  of roads conditions, traffic, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to push some extra mileage in the evening we tried to take a back roads short cut around Jalgaon, against the advice of the locals.  That didn&acirc;??t work out so well.  We also ended up being commandeered as a taxi cab for the chief of police of Erandol, who told us his town didn&acirc;??t have any decent lodging.  Not sure if he was just trying to run us out of his town or telling the truth. But we embarked on our first stint of highway night driving to get to Parola for the night.  It&acirc;??s pretty scary when you can see the potholes better by the light of oncoming traffic (in your lane since they&acirc;??re passing someone) than you can by your own headlights&acirc;?&brvbar;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=''1'' height=''1'' src=''https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2883997969551391628-7125076949120620518?l=safety3rd.blogspot.com''/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;', NULL, NULL, 'Day 8', 'http://safety3rd.blogspot.com/2008/01/day-8.html', 1, 'dlott', NULL, 'Ajanta Caves', 1, NULL, NULL);

Less than a kilometer after pulling out of the petrol station after filling up this morning our rickshaw started losing power, then died, and refused to start again.  When draining the gas and replacing it, and taking the carburetor apart looking at it and putting it back together didn''t solve the problem (Cyrus is quite proud that he was able to take the carburetor apart and put it back together and have it work by the way), we eventually had Lott and Slepak bring us a mechanic from town who discovered that our spark plug had issues.  A little sand papering and cleaning later, along with some tweaks to the engine idle, and we were back in business running fine.  Unfortunately during the fixing process we neglected to keep an eye on our screw driver with replaceable nibs and it &quot;disappeared.&quot;  We''re assuming one of the many kids who were around watching us made off with it.  Our funnel also disappeared, but that one is probably mostly due to team negligence as we had left it on top of the rickshaw during the fixing process and we probably just forgot to take it down before doing the test drive with the mechanic and it fell off somewhere along the way never to be seen again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two lane &quot;super highway&quot; for the next few hours allowed us to make good time most of the afternoon, and we made it into Varanasi and Hotel Divya a little after dark.

We ate lunch with &quot;Discovering the Earth&quot; near Khozikide beach while we were still far to the south (on a side note, that lunch featured the best tasting bread we''ve ever had and we''re still trying to figure out what it was that we had so we can order it again).  We tried to convince them to come eat dinner with us again this evening, but they were retiring early so they could see a temple in the morning and then press on through Bihar and toward Kathmandu in the afternoon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of retiring, that is where I am going to head and leave further blog posting in the able hands of Lott and Slepak as we''re planning on waking up very early tomorrow morning in order to catch a boat and watch the sun rise on the river.

Well, aside from gazing at the spectacle of, I&acirc;??m not sure what, that is Varanasi, we did a few productive things: bought a few blankets to make it a bit warmer in the rickshaws before reaching the Nepali mountains, I built a &acirc;??door&acirc;?? in ours, out of plastic and duct tape to shield against the wind a little better, and having learned our lesson from the day before, when Cyrus and Logan&acirc;??s  rickshaw died from a dirty sparkplug, I picked up a pair of spare spark plugs&acirc;?&brvbar; Back to Tuesday: having left Varanasi, we had a rather reasonable goal of reaching the famous Buddhist shrine of Bodhgaya (where Buddhism originated). This was a fairly reasonable 250 km away, so we were well on our way, even with a late start&acirc;?&brvbar; until about 7PM, when our rickshaw promptly died. Having now learned from the local mechanics that most rickshaw problems are caused by either the gas supply system or the spark plug, we didn&acirc;??t waste any time in taking our old spark plug out, and replacing it with one of the spares. This worked great&acirc;?&brvbar; for a couple of hours, when the rickshaw died again&acirc;?&brvbar; This time we managed to verify that the fuel was, in fact getting delivered, the carburetor was spotlessly clean, the air filter was clean&acirc;?&brvbar; and the spark plug? Well, we didn&acirc;??t have to check that since we just replaced it, right? Having exhausted all the options we could think of (and watching Logan fall asleep in his rickshaw as the clock wound past midnight), we gave up and decided to simply tow the rickshaw to the next town and deal with it in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/R4-IP1DaOXI/AAAAAAAADPA/WJIuWt1Qv8s/s1600-h/hole.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/R4-IP1DaOXI/AAAAAAAADPA/WJIuWt1Qv8s/s400/hole.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;The hole in the piston!&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5156489903883303282&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, we first discovered some good news: there was an actual Bajaj dealership/service center just across the street from our hotel! Then we found some bad news: for all the things that are wrong with the state of Bihar, they have gotten some things right: 2 stroke rickshaws (like ours) are not sold in Bihar, which is great for the environment, but not so great for us, since this means our mechanic doesn&acirc;??t generally deal with rickshaws like ours and doesn&acirc;??t have a lot of spare parts for it available. And then, we found the really bad news: the reason our rickshaw had stopped running was that there now was a sizeable hole in our piston! Rewinding, it quickly became apparent that the spare spark plugs I had purchased did not fit our engine, and after pounding on the piston for about two hours, the spark plug had burst a hole in it&acirc;?&brvbar; (Lesson learned: just because the guy at the shop swears that he knows what he&acirc;??s doing and that the spark plug you had asked for will fit your engine, don&acirc;??t believe him! Double check then! And triple check again, before actually installing the sparkplug!). On the bright side, we finally knew what the problem was and could start trying to solve it &acirc;?? the service center, of course, did not have the specific part we needed, but eventually found a similar one that fit, and over 4 hours and 1600 Rupees (~$50) later, our rickshaw was alive again! This, finally (finally!) allowed us to get back on the road, and by 5:30, we reached Bodhgaya.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/R4-IQFDaOZI/AAAAAAAADPQ/LLz0ZNb1Uy4/s1600-h/temple.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/R4-IQFDaOZI/AAAAAAAADPQ/LLz0ZNb1Uy4/s400/temple.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;The temple at night&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5156489908178270610&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was largely the end of the adventure for the day, as we simply went  sight-seeing visiting the famous temple, getting immersed in a sea of Buddhist monks from every corner of the universe that were there (I hear Buddha&acirc;??s actual birthday is this week, so it must be an especially busy time). Thursday, with a three-rickshaw caravan fully intact once more, we were finally able to get an early start to the day (left at 6:15 AM) and head off towards Darjeeling and the Nepalese border!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&acirc;??m typing this, the caravan is somewhere on the way to Darjeeling, I however, split off from them just before 1 in the afternoon in order to go to Dehli for a former co-worker&acirc;??s wedding reception on Saturday (so I don&acirc;??t really know how far they&acirc;??ve gone, but I suspect I would&acirc;??ve heard by now if something had gone seriously wrong). Sunday, fly back from Dehli to Darjeeling and meet back up with the crew! Currently, sitting in my hotel room in Patna, the capital of Bihar, and a wholly unremarkable city &acirc;?? will try to find some sights to see early tomorrow before catching a flight to Dehli in the evening, where I meet up with Michelle again, and we&acirc;??re both off to the reception on Saturday, assuming everything goes to plan!&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=''1'' height=''1'' src=''https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2883997969551391628-4341048581371122159?l=safety3rd.blogspot.com''/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;', NULL, NULL, 'Varanasi and beyond', 'http://safety3rd.blogspot.com/2008/01/varanasi-and-beyond.html', 1, 'Alex', NULL, 'Varanasi, Gaya', 1, NULL, NULL);

Wondering if maybe it''s my parents not quite getting the time difference right, decide to pick it up: turns out it''s only Cyrus... clearly unaware that I have little desire to be awake at 6 in the morning, while away from the rickshaws! So, an update on the caravan: after dropping me off in the afternoon. continued to make good progress towards Darjeeling, and stopped for the night in Purnia. No problems with the rickshaws, and will probably be reaching Darjeeling/the border crossing later today. Depending on how much time they want to spend in Darjeeling, I''ll fly back from Dehli either to Darjeeling or to somewhere in Nepal to meet back up with them (the second option involves Lott being able to take our rickshaw into Nepal without me there, which should work, but may bring up some extra questions...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the mean time, I''m in Putna. Getting to Putna involved navigating the Indian railway system, which is actually not as terrible of an experience as one might expect (if you''re only on the train for three hours). Met a guy there traveling all across the country from Nagaland, in the very, very eastern part of the coutry all the way to Mumbai - that''s a multi-day journey I don''t want to try... The guy, Imtinungkum was actually quite interesting - he is a Christian missionary (Nagaland is mostly Christian) working in Mumbai, and was just on the way back after spending Christmas back home. They also don''t speak Hindi in in Nagaland, so he was also using mostly English to communicate with the others on the train... And he spoke rather good English. And was appropriately surprised to hear that I was in the midst of driving an auto-rickshaw across India, much like everyone else here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now finally in Putna... Lonely Planet isn''t particularly impressed with the city, struggling to find a couple of attractions to see - one being a granary built by the British over two centuries ago, which should offer great views of the city and the Ganges river, but instead was offering great views of the haze covering the city and the river this morning! (not sure how much of it was pollution and how much was just clouds, but I''m fairly certain it was a combination). The other is a Sikh temple, which I may still go to, but it''s 11km away, so it''s a fairly long ways away... Then again, I don''t have much else to do right now! 7:30 tonight, fly to Dehli. On one hand though, Putna is quite refreshing - after the tourist meccas of Varanasi of Bodhgaya, it''s nice to not be immersed in a sea of beggars, eager salesmen, and competing rickshaw drivers (actually those are still here...).

We wanted to be gone before they discovered that we used the curtain to mop up the mess, and fortunately the guys with guns in the lobby had made sure our rickshaws didn''t &quot;wander off&quot; overnight. There was a heavy fog, but we were itching to get out of Bihar so we decided to press on. We encountered a toll both that had been staffed by some friendly locals. Normally we run such setups, and Tommy did, bringing one of the locals along with him who''d grabbed the center pillar. Since Slepak''s bags were in the back seat due to the broken roof rack, I decided that 10 Rs. was a reasonable bribe for them to ask and paid it to save Slepak''s bags.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;The roads were pretty good and we could make about 30kph and still be able to see oncoming traffic. The tricky bit is that some of that traffic is ox drawn carts which are really slow (and don''t have lights). The lorries can''t really pass them so they end up going slow too and you''re really tempted to pass them. But you can''t see oncoming traffic. But Tommy''s leading. And he''s crazy (rode a motorcycle from London to Mongolia) And no one wants to be alone in the fog in Bihar. So you assume when Tommy passes someone, it''s safe for you to follow. And then he swerves left way too quickly and you see the close set headlights of a tractor hauling a cartload of sugarcane. And then you find your brakes are surprisingly effective as all three wheels lock up and you frantically skid sideways trying to tuck in behind the lorry and miss the tractor. And you give the guys in the chase rick a heart attack.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;We decided to stop for breakfast, of amazing puri, to let the fog clear and lecture Tommy on passing etiquette. Neither worked. Fortunately the finished portion of the road ended and passing on broken dirt went much more sedately. It also kicked up a lot of dust which turned to mud on the windshields.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5157057153987728018&quot; style=&quot;DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yG3LJbOEQIc/R5GMKIXTUpI/AAAAAAAABpM/xLrYgXVmkOc/s400/directions.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eventually the fog burned off and the road returned to being paved and we sped on to guided by by helpful signs like the above. A quick stop by the Bajaj Service Center to tighten the muffler yet again, and an entertaining railway crossing where a 5 year old was walking around with a big snake in a basket offering to let us take pictures (100 Rs, sorry no pictures) and hit the mountains. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;The road to Darjeeling tenuously clings to the hill side. On your left, there''s a sheer drop to terraced tea plantations. On your right, there are jungles. A railway line weaves back and forth across the road as you drop the rickshaw into third gear, open the throttle and race up. Along the way all the locals smiled and waved.

So the five of us (Dave, Dave, Alex, Tommy, and I) got in our three rickshaws and headed over to the Rum Doodle Bar (40,000 &Acirc;&frac12; feet) to work out what we needed to do to return the rickshaws. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There we met up with two other teams Discovering Earth who we had ran into quite a few times and a team of absolutely insane Brits one of who decided to return their rickshaw with us.  So the 8 of us started driving convoy style through Kathmandu following our carefully planned out route.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Random Fact:  Less than a week ago the government of Napal raised the price of gas about 20%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We made if a few blocks when we hit the first protest.  We looked at our map and rerouted.  Made it a few more blocks hit protest number two.  Rerouted again.  and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally we stopped and after much work convinced a cabbie to park his cab and jump in one of our rickshaws and get us past the protests.  He was certain there wouldn''t be protesters on the big ring roads if we could just get out to them.  We then ran into two more groups of protesters who the cabbie talked to briefly and they moved stuff out of the way so we could get through.  Most of the protesters went out of their way to be nice to tourists and went through what appeared to be the last protest before the ring road my rickshaw was nailed in the back by a brick. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Random Note: Most protests we encountered were just folks blocking the road and burning things.  Small bushes, limbs of trees, tires etc. and chanting something that I assume translates to &quot;Down with the King&quot; but I can''t say I''ve learned much Nepalese since I''ve been here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Logan and I were a bit put out by the rude folks throwing large rocks at our rather flimsy go cart but we were driving away from the at about 50km and hour and they couldn''t catch us.  We had less than 2km to go and we were finally on the &quot;Safe&quot; ring road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Random Fact: At this point we are in position 4 in the convoy.  It''s order was (Tommy + Cabbie, Discovering Earth, Crazy Brits, Us, Lott + Slepak)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We came around a bend in the ring road and turned down a hill towards what appeared to be the largest protest we had seen that day.  The cabbie told Tommy to go ahead that they wouldn''t bother us.  So all of us went heading right for the protest.  Time compressed at this point and I''m not sure how everything that follows went down.  The crowd caught up with us and they was a group of people throwing rocks at the rickshaw and kicking it while I was trying desperately to turn it around.  Finally I just floored it and tried to make all 7hp of that thing take off even though I hadn''t made it all around and there were protesters in front of me.  They got out of the way though.  Discovering Earth stalled and was the last ones out.  Oddly Tommy was suspiciously the first one out and as we were flying up the hill in flee mode he was sitting out of his tuk tuk taking pictures of us getting attacked (Film camera, we''ll get copies someday)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that we ducked into the airport with it''s significant military presence and parked our rickshaws to regroup and settle down. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEY WERE THROWING BRICKS AT US!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After consulting with not less than 20 people including military, random locals, cabbies, UN Folks, and airport officials we came to the conclusion that we had to wait it out at the airport.  They almost let us just drive across the cargo area to get where we were going but one of the chief types at the airport realized this would violate international air laws.  So we did what we''ve always done in the face of adversity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We went to the bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We got out of there about 3.5 hours later once the protests had broken up and drove to the drop off point. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Random fact: Team Dave, and I are presently at the airport getting out of this country.  As a rule of thumb I don''t hang out in countries where the locals have tried to kill me.  Protests were still going today and a general strike also started.  Lott and I are in the Thai Airways lounge which might be the best place in the city to hold up and wait to get out.  Logan is downstairs working on getting a ticket but sadly the airport is closed due to weather and he can''t buy a ticket until the weather lifts.  But we expect him to join us here in the next couple hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex and Tommy have decided that they''ll just wonder up to the Everest base camp in the middle of winter.

At first we weren''t sure what it was used for, as it seemed too narrow for any real passengers. The cars are significantly larger than the train track would make you think, and it turns out there is in fact a steam engine that runs back and forth between Darjeeling, Ghum, and various other towns on the mountain a few times a day.

Upon arriving, we were introduced to some astounding statistics:&lt;br /&gt; - the Whistler resort opened this year a week before Thanksgiving, which is their regular opening weekend&lt;br /&gt; - they opened so early because by November 20th, the mountain had already experienced over 500cm of snowfall!&lt;br /&gt; - I can''t remember what the previous record for November was (or what it was for any month), but Whistler set a new record for snowfall for &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt; month before Thanksgiving&lt;br /&gt; - in fact, the 520+ cms of snow they had received by the time we showed up was already more than half of the average &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;annual&lt;/span&gt; snowfall that the mountain receives!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, we were, understandably, pretty excited!

Well, first, we made dinner, actually, where Mara discovered a rather amusing label on a Canadian carton of milk:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SxeLF8g0tMI/AAAAAAAAIgo/PCs541F-9RM/s1600-h/homomilk.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 309px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SxeLF8g0tMI/AAAAAAAAIgo/PCs541F-9RM/s400/homomilk.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5410946411568346306&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Homo Milk for the win!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don''t have any pictures from the hot tub, and I really can''t see how pictures from that hot tub would''ve ended well for the cameras, so we''ll just skip to the following morning, when we all woke up a little groggy at 7 in the morning, but were quite pleased to be greeted with the sight of even more fresh snow outside:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SxeLFHoG5II/AAAAAAAAIgY/T-iK098EAH0/s1600-h/am.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SxeLFHoG5II/AAAAAAAAIgY/T-iK098EAH0/s400/am.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5410946397371819138&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;First thing I saw out the window in the morning was, well... snow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SxeLhdcpciI/AAAAAAAAIhg/_z_8vxdpuBY/s1600-h/snow.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SxeLhdcpciI/AAAAAAAAIhg/_z_8vxdpuBY/s400/snow.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5410946884265669154&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And more snow outside...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the build-up was quite exciting. The day on the mountain itself didn''t turn out quite as well - it was nice to ride through the fresh snow, but unfortunately, a lot of the mountain was closed due to the high winds at the top, and in a lot of places, the fresh powder was covering over frozen ice underneath.  However, Whistler is a huge mountain, and you can have a lot of fun no matter what, so maybe it could''ve been a little more perfect, but I can''t complain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SxeLGHOnUjI/AAAAAAAAIgw/1pBCdp1fNfc/s1600-h/lott.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SxeLGHOnUjI/AAAAAAAAIgw/1pBCdp1fNfc/s400/lott.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5410946414444761650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Lott carving through the fresh snow in the morning&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SxeLh-t9TxI/AAAAAAAAIhs/KH9nxBOoKZw/s1600-h/theo.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SxeLh-t9TxI/AAAAAAAAIhs/KH9nxBOoKZw/s400/theo.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5410946893196644114&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Theo being one with the terrain park&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SxeLf5twqxI/AAAAAAAAIhA/ReQiMlANQ5A/s1600-h/peak2peak.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SxeLf5twqxI/AAAAAAAAIhA/ReQiMlANQ5A/s400/peak2peak.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5410946857493900050&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;After lunch we got on the new Peak2Peak chair to cross over from Whistler to Blackcomb, watching the gondolas almost get lost in the low clouds before emerging on the other side&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SxeLFTgXlyI/AAAAAAAAIgg/vpnGWsLyBnQ/s1600-h/hole.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SxeLFTgXlyI/AAAAAAAAIgg/vpnGWsLyBnQ/s400/hole.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5410946400560584482&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Some of the gondolas have a hole (well, window) in the bottom.

What actually struck me was more of carelessness when I took the picture above, put my camera away, and went off for a ride through the terrain park. Yes, things have a magical way of going wrong in the terrain park, but that didn''t happen. What did happen was that I missed a step - the one about zipping up the pocket after placing the camera there. And all of a sudden, at the bottom of the run, I discovered that I no longer had a camera, so carelessness! We went back up and took the same run again searching for the camera, and finding absolutely nothing... But! There are pictures in this post, so the camera wasn''t lost forever! I had actually already gone ahead and ordered a replacement camera, when I got a call from Whistler informing me that my camera had been found! So, a day later, I had my camera back, and we get this post with lots of pictures. Admittedly, some of the pictures you''re actually seeing are from Tina''s and Amanda''s cameras... So, after all that crazy excitement, a couple more shots from later on Saturday:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SxeLGuvthlI/AAAAAAAAIg4/bkBhdaiYE5g/s1600-h/ninja.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SxeLGuvthlI/AAAAAAAAIg4/bkBhdaiYE5g/s400/ninja.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5410946425052563026&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Having a drink after the day on the hill.

Everyone else stayed around for another day, which worked out amazingly well for me as the camera showed up on Sunday... So, a few more pictures from the trip: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2042884&amp;id=1046387715&amp;l=588837c558&quot;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2042884&amp;id=1046387715&amp;l=588837c558&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=''1'' height=''1'' src=''https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2883997969551391628-4315317557989379731?l=safety3rd.blogspot.com'' alt='''' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;', NULL, NULL, 'Whistler and the record snow fall of ''09', 'http%3A%2F%2Fsafety3rd.blogspot.com%2F2009%2F12%2Fwhistler-and-record-snow-fall-of-09.html', 1, 'Alex', NULL, 'Whistler', 2, NULL, NULL);

You gotta stop doing this shit, man - they are gonna catch you and put you in the fucking chair!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Seattle is a perfectly safe city, but as I''ve been walking around a lot more lately, occasionally I now get to overhear an interesting conversation - the above was one end of a phone exchange. I reflected that it''s nice that I wasn''t walking anywhere particularly near the guy on the other end of the call. Tina, Bailey, and Brodie felt the conversation needed to be shared with the blog (which we have, admittedly, been neglecting a bit lately), so here it is - an update on the excitement in my life these days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of Tina, Bailey, and Brodie, we were having this conversation on the way to Mt. Baker last Sunday, because winter has shown up in Washington State early this year, bringing with it amazing amounts of early snow, and prompting all the local resorts to open operations at record-setting early dates. So, off we went, and wonderful it was! The whole mountain was already open, hardly any lift lines (as is the norm at Baker) and lots of fresh powder, including 11 fresh inches overnight. Yes, the visibility could''ve been better, but I don''t think any of us were about to complain! I''ve recently concluded that the winter rather sucks in Seattle, what with all the rain, and cold, and wind, but the snow in the mountains does generally make it worthwhile:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/Sw-HXlAqevI/AAAAAAAAIgQ/nbvMOwXTFMs/s1600/lift.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/Sw-HXlAqevI/AAAAAAAAIgQ/nbvMOwXTFMs/s400/lift.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5408690516636891890&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;All four of us on the lift.

So I posted and lo and behold, early the following morning, I had a response from an Angelina Mandy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hi&lt;br /&gt;i am intrested in your sale kindly mail me back if still available.......... &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Angelina sounded just a bit fishy, but, why not, I informed ''her'' that yes, the camera was still available. Follow-up response:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your response.I am located at Waco,tx but presently on Business trip abroad,i gat my cell phone stolen,if not would av rung you,This Item is a replica of what i want for my Brother who is in abroad at the mo. sorting out his project &acirc;?&brvbar;I will add shipping charges confirm from http://www.usps.com for international shipping making it a total of $250.00 &acirc;?&brvbar;&acirc;?&brvbar;.I will make the total payment if you&acirc;??ll kindly help me handle the shipping.You can send me the paypal info and i&acirc;??ll make the payment right away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we know it''s a scam, of course, and, these days, I get amused by scammers. I''m not actually sure exactly how this one works, but Paypal does generally operate on the ''protect the buyer, screw the seller'' ethos, and craigslist specifically warns not to give out your PayPal info on its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.craigslist.org/about/scams&quot;&gt;scams page&lt;/a&gt;, even though I''m not actually sure what our ''angelina'' would be able to do with the email address that my PayPal account is registered under, however I didn''t want to find that out, but, as I said, I was feeling a little bored, so late the following evening I replied:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That sounds wonderful, unfortunately, I do not have a PayPal account - but, instead, you can just send me your bank account number, and I will authorize my bank to transfer the $250 from your account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I''ve checked a little with my intelligence contacts, and you have been recommended to me as a very trustworthy person, so I hope you will be willing to help us, as I''ve been placed in charge of dispersing the funds of the deposed royal family of Myanmar. So, once you send me your bank account number, I have been authorized to deposit an additional sum of 1,000,000 US dollars in your account. The money is perfectly legal, and this is simply a way of preventing the military dictatorship, currently in charge of the country, from illegitimately stealing the royal family''s funds. In exchange for your assistance in holding the money in your account for a period of 30 days, you will be rewarded with 10% of the total sum, or $100,000 US dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look forward to hearing from you,&lt;br /&gt;Alex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. I had a good laugh at your message, hopefully you have one too, before you fuck off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was feeling pretty good about my composition skills, and felt ''angie'' could learn something for the her future scams about not always having the inheritance money come from Africa. Sadly, however, my angelina was apparently too busy managing other scams out of the Lagos, Nigeria (I presume) central office, to play along, so the only response I got said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its a serious buyer....ok&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ahh, ''angie'', you are ruining all of entertainment...

The city of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pachinko_parlour.jpg&quot;&gt;pachinko&lt;/a&gt; machines, unnecessarily complicated subways, and home of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sakura-hostel.co.jp/&quot;&gt;Sakura hostel&lt;/a&gt;, where I stayed before and am staying now. So Tokyo is still much too weird to actually feel like home, but it does feel fairly familiar, even a little comfortable perhaps. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trip over here was started with damn near torrential downpours in LA and San Diego (an event that the American Airlines ground crews are entirely unprepared for judging by the fact that my checked bag arrived still wet, twelve hours later in Tokyo). And, of course, I got to re-confirm that 12 hour flights still suck, even if JAL makes it a bit less intolerable than the AA alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Random things I''ve found/remembered in my first few hours in Tokyo:&lt;br /&gt; - it''s true, the Japanese are wholly paranoid about germs. I saw plenty of face masks last year, there''s even more of them now, in the face of Avian/swine/etc. flus. Including the guy that was sitting next to me on the flight.&lt;br /&gt; - on the subway, I was reminded of the fact that the people here are either sleep deprived, or just really like to nap in positions I would find wholly uncomfortable while on the subway. Young, old, men, women, everybody''s taking naps on the train.&lt;br /&gt; - the iPhones are coming! the iPhones are coming! This one is particularly painful as I left mine behind in San Diego, but it is nice to see some iPhones supplementing the wholly ubiquitous Japanese phones. Not sure if iPhone 3G was even out yet when I was here a year ago, but I certainly didn''t see any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I''ll come up with a few more witty observations before I leave Japan, I''m sure, in the mean time, I''m only here for a few days - three nights in Tokyo, two more in Nagoya (meeting up with friends in both places), then making my way down to Osaka for a flight down to Manila, and the tropical warm archipelago that is the Philippines. Started reading the Philippines guide book on the flight over - I wish I had more than 10 days to see the place!

Cebu Pacific, a Filipino discount airline which got me from Japan to Manila last night, is admittedly nowhere near five-star status. However, having an exit row seat means plenty of leg room, and not having anyone sitting in the middle seat, means plenty of elbow room as well, so luxury and style! There are admittedly a few limitations to exit row seating - the seats don''t recline and your bags all have to be overhead. There''s also some limitations to discount airlines - food for purchase and a 15kg luggage limitation, but all in all, it was better than I might have expected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;highway bus vs. the gaijin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before climbing aboard my Cebu Pacific Airbus, I needed to get from Nagoya to Osaka. This was accomplished by virtue of a Willer Express highway bus - the cheapest, and reasonably convenient, way I''ve found to get around Japan. At boarding time, they have a full list of all the passengers seats assigned and all. All the names are in Japanese... except for one: Aleksandr Slepak at the top. So, in order to board the bus, I chose to simply smile and point to my name. This was sufficient - no id checks, nobody even wanted to look at my confirmation printout... When you are the only ''gaijin'' on the bus, Japan doesn''t really want to deal with you, they just hope you won''t cause any trouble.

Somehow, I don''t really think of wine when coming to Japan though. Sake? Sure. A bar featuring 300 hundred different types of tequila? I''ll introduce you to the Iranian guy running it in Tokyo...

You are also hit in the face with warm vibrant air, the screams of touts trying to sell you everything under the sun, and more often than not, the scents of exotic cuisine. Manila is no exception, and the contrast is especially stark coming from Japan (Singapore may be renowned for its cleanliness, but Japan is certainly the cleanest country in the world).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience started when I landed around 10:30 at night and hailed a taxi to go to the nearest LRT (light rail) station. We arrived 15 minutes later, and chaos immediately ensued. The driver couldn''t actually drop me off right in front of the station, as, with Christmas approaching, the market has taken over several adjacent streets, so I walked for 10 minutes through a sea of humanity buying, selling, screaming, arguing - living their chaos. Then I got to the station, discovered that it had actually closed two hours ago, and had to walk back... I do wonder what the cab driver thought of the foreigner who appeared out of the middle of nowhere, with a large backpack on, to hail his cab, but he got me to my hostel 30 minutes later for a price that''s still less than an average subway ride in Tokyo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Navigating around Manila is also a bit chaotic as there seems to always be traffic, and while there are street signs, there seems to be an alarming lack of numbers marked on any (well, most) of the buildings, so finding an address can take a while. While I wouldn''t have expected my cabbie to have known anything about the Red Carabao hostel on Felix Huertas street, I was a little surprised when my driver ths morning also had to stop and ask for directions to get to the World Trade Center building, home of Manila''s Chinese embassy. Fortunately, Manila seems to be overflowing with guards of various sorts, who, while seemingly not doing much else, are good for providing directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;lingua franca&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What do you get when you take a country, whose population is almost entirely indigenous, have Spain colonize it for a few centuries, then have the US come in and take over in the 20th century? Well, confusion, as far as I can tell. I suspect Manila is not actually representative of the rest of the country, but as that''s all I''ve seen so far, here''s what I''ve found:&lt;br /&gt; - vast majority of signage on the streets (let''s say 60%) is just in English. All advertising and street shops are posted in English. At the malls, you often hear English spoken as the first language behind the counters, even though the people on both side of the conversation are Filipino. Most people do speak I language I do not understand, so presumably Tagalog.&lt;br /&gt; - some signs are in English and Tagalog. Safety warnings and instructions and such. I''ll give these 35% maybe. That might be generous for the upscale shopping and business neighborhoods, like Makati.&lt;br /&gt; - the remaining 5% is just Tagalog - you have to search for these. They are usually official government signs of some sort&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Spanish you''ll note, however, Manila has a distinctly Latin American feel to it, and it''s not just the near-tropical climate. The street names are all Spanish, and I can occasionally pick up a word or two in the Tagalog conversation that seems derived from the Spanish language. Catholicism is king, of course, and there''s plenty of churches, while the jeepney, the preferred method of local transport, appears to be straight out of Central America central casting:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SyXktdFPA6I/AAAAAAAAIk4/y08QCTv89GI/s1600-h/jeepney.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SyXktdFPA6I/AAAAAAAAIk4/y08QCTv89GI/s400/jeepney.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5414985596534719394&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Santa Cruz vs. Santa Cruz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my hostel here in Manila is in the Santa Cruz neighborhood. When I arrived last night, it immediately struck me that it reminded me of something. This morning, it finally came to me - it reminds me of the hostel I stayed in in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, of course! Both used to be relatively upscale private houses that have been converted to a new life as hostels. The patently un-hostel-like fancy bathrooms are a dead give-away... Wonder what Santa Cruz in California''s like?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Happy Holidays&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I''ve heard loud-speakers at the malls here in Manila (in English, of course) reminding potential customers that Christmas is only 11 days away. Both Japan and the Philippines are fully decked out in Christmas decor - perfectly sensible in a deeply religious Catholic country like the Philippines, a bit strange in a largely secular, and Buddhist, if anything, country like Japan, but I''m only here to observe, not to judge...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SyXj_cOFQHI/AAAAAAAAIjw/JYTWljBtRZc/s1600-h/chistmas.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SyXj_cOFQHI/AAAAAAAAIjw/JYTWljBtRZc/s400/chistmas.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5414984806029410418&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Umeda Building in Osaka wishing you a Merry Christmas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SyXkth24nwI/AAAAAAAAIlA/Wc_fe8CwUFs/s1600-h/jesus.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SyXkth24nwI/AAAAAAAAIlA/Wc_fe8CwUFs/s400/jesus.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5414985597816708866&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And a display on the street in Manila reminding you how the whole thing got started&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SyXktHvU3KI/AAAAAAAAIkw/erTzV_teKpk/s1600-h/gena.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SyXktHvU3KI/AAAAAAAAIkw/erTzV_teKpk/s400/gena.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5414985590805683362&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This isn''t holiday related, this is Gena and Cheburashka, from a Russian children''s cartoon, I used to watch growing up.

I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The collective consisted of the driver, the conductor in charge of the passengers and cargo, some 50 locals varying in age from about six weeks to, well, elderly, and five of us tourists in the middle of it all - me, a German couple, and a couple from Chula Vista, CA - practically my parents'' neighbors in nearby San Diego.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some fifteen [uncomfortably hot and sticky] minutes later, the monster belched to life and rumbled off towards the jungle. Some 45 minutes earlier, I had just come back to my hostel, having learned that I would not be doing the dive trip I had come looking for (typhoon season!), which got me to trying to reach Sabang, which got me to the fire-breathing monster at the bus terminal. It''s supposed to depart at noon, but tends to actually go when full - be it earlier or later, and since this was the last Sabanga bus for the day, I was feeling pretty good about being aboard as it pulled away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our driver cajoled the screeching beast along the twisty, surprisingly well paved roads for the next three hours until we reached the far side of Palawan island, and the tourist enclave of Sabang, home of Palawan''s signature attraction - the underground river, UNESCO recognized. At one point, the asphalt had abruptly ended just as we passed a sister-beast, heading in the opposite direction, with a dozen people riding on the roof exchanging pleasantries with their comrades on our roof. The beasts merely snorted at each other...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no actual bus stops on Palawan, so to get off you just knock on the beast''s metal roof, the bus stops and the conductor produces your luggage (or your pack of bamboo sticks... or your live chicken) from the smorgasbord of packages occupying the roof. Since there are no actual stops, everyone expects to be dropped off precisely at their front door, even if we had just stopped 30 meters earlier to drop off your neighbor - walking is so twentieth century! I kept a wary eye on the people and packages getting off, hoping to spot the guy who may decide to take off with my backpack - noone did... Noone took off with the ten packs of bamboo sticks we had loaded onto the roof along the way either - I calmly and pragmatically figured that anything which complicated the situation on the roof also served to reduce the odds of my backpack walking away, so I welcomed the addition of the bamboo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About two hours into the trip, the beast, bright green in color, sputtered around a sharp corner, and a view of the bay greeted us - a yellow ring of sand hugging the coast where the stately bright green palm trees were coming down to dip their toes in the water, while somber green peaks were rising up meet the sky a bit further beyond the shore. Perfect. Picture-perfect, in fact!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So perfect, in fact, that I''d figured I''d come here to spend my birthday - if I can''t be up in Seattle with my friends, I might as well be surrounded by beautiful pristine shoreline here on Palawan instead...

Otherwise we just lose money on the diesel...&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;How much is the diesel?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Dunno, captain says 5,600&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marty''s on a budget, so he declares he''s out, Till demands 1,500, and says they''d think about when the price doesn''t move off of 1,800 Pesos. I quietly observe and sip my 6.9 percent alcohol Red Horse. Once the boat guys leave, Till and Hannah are in, of course, but prefer to make the announcement the next morning, hoping to finagle more of a discount. Marty says he''ll stop by in the morning to say good bye, we all got back to our drinks. I promise to buy Till a beer if and when we actually get to El Nido for 1,800 - I reserve skepticism for all unsubstantiated promises made to foreigners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Friday, December 18th&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;@ the boat office, again&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Till, Hannah, you should catch the bus before it leaves - our boat is going to Port Barton&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;What!? But, we''re now in for El Nido, which is all you needed yesterday to make the trip to El Nido!?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;captain says no&quot; [I think the captain may not be of legal drinking age in the States]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;but what about yesterday!? You promised...&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Well, you see, the French couple canceled yesterday, and if Marty''s not going, the three of you isn''t enough...&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;That''s bullshit! That''s not what you said yesterday, and we''ve made plans based on what you said!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[sounding conciliatory - good thing we are not in Vietnam or Russia...] &quot;Let me ask the captain...&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;captain: &quot;2,000 pesos each&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Till: &quot;fine...&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;me [silently], so we''ve gone from 2,000, minimum five passengers to 1,800 &quot;for you guys&quot;, to 2,000 for the three of you? Guess diesel prices have dropped, but I think, overall, my situation has only improved... Tally-ho!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so that''s how Till, Hannah, and I ended up on board of the bangka Sweet Reeza May, having waved good bye to Marty and joined by a couple from the Australia''s Northern Territory (where noone else is from, as I helpfully pointed out), and a German tourist filling the role of Sketchy Man - local superhero accompanied by a Filipino girl less than half his age... Of legal age though, I''m fairly certain, so maybe those crazy kids are really in love...

I figured he had come to seek revenge for his brothers and sisters we &lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SmZBWXl0rpI/AAAAAAAAITY/onzUGwnIjOg/s1600-h/lobster.jpg&quot;&gt;had for lunch back in the San Blas&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I went diving! And took lots of pictures after having invested in an underwater case for my camera. How would you describe diving in El Nido? Well, personally, I like seeing the big things - sharks, eels, turtles, rays, etc. (a place called Donsol, on the East side of the archipelago is a place where you can snorkel with gigantic whale sharks, which reach up to 20 feet in length(!). drooling...). None of those live here on the Northwestern tip of Palawan, so I wouldn''t describe it as spectacular (that would be nearby Borneo), however, even a non-spectacular dive site in the South Pacific still happens to be amazing - the coral reefs, the myriads of fish, an occasional surprise like a big, angry looking lobster, beautiful warm waters, I don''t know how much else you can really ask for! Of all the places I''ve dived (and I''m now apparently up to 25 dives!), the South Pacific sites have been unmistakably the best - Fiji, Borneo, Thailand, Japan''s Okinawa chain, and now the Philippines. New Zealand is just as good as far as diving goes, but it''s quite a bit colder in the water. Vietnam''s Halong Bay is crap because there''s absolutely no visibility and the dive shop was incompetent (and I didn''t like Vietnam...), but I hear there are some amazing sites down the Southern coast. So, really, you have to wonder why you''d dive anywhere else (and I have, and will again, but it just won''t be as good). Costa Rica was good - we saw rays and turtles, but it still lacked the ridiculous assortment of fish and coral. Croatia is just crap in comparison, and that''s one of the better sites in the Mediterranean... I hear Egypt''s famous for the wrecks, but I have a hard time imagining it can match the wildlife. Well, you shouldn''t take my word for it, I suppose - I haven''t been... you should go and find out, I eventually intend to, even if I don''t think it can live up to the South Pacific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There''s also the price - two dives, all equipment and lunch included, here on Palawan was about $60 USD, or at least 40% less than I''ve paid anywhere else so far! Next time I''m here in the Philippines (and like just about every other place I''ve been to, I want there to be a next time, even if I don''t have any idea if or when it might happen), it''ll need to be between March and June, so a trip to the outlying Tubattha reefs will be possible on a live aboard, as those are considered the absolute best dive sites in the archipelago...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In between the dives, we had lunch on one of the islands, where I snuck away briefly to snap a few pictures of the crazy karst formations making up these islands:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SzOt4brCYeI/AAAAAAAAIoY/K6MknSmykeg/s1600-h/rock.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 267px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SzOt4brCYeI/AAAAAAAAIoY/K6MknSmykeg/s400/rock.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5418865961669386722&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SzOt49upGTI/AAAAAAAAIog/DsSFRHAT7Nk/s1600-h/hole.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SzOt49upGTI/AAAAAAAAIog/DsSFRHAT7Nk/s400/hole.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5418865970811312434&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SzOt4IlwGCI/AAAAAAAAIoQ/Ei5Q_HbTqPA/s1600-h/pasage.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SzOt4IlwGCI/AAAAAAAAIoQ/Ei5Q_HbTqPA/s400/pasage.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5418865956546943010&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that was the diving. That evening I debated catching a ferry [an expensive ferry] to Coron island the following day to dive its famous ship wrecks, but after some internal debate, I concluded that it would just be too rushed, and El Nido was too nice, and the people running our guesthouse were too friendly, so I stayed for another couple of days. The next day, Till, Hannah, and I met up with Ria, whom I had met on the diving trip, and we went on our little motorcycle tour of the Northern part of Palawan island. I drove one of the bikes, Ria trusted me not to kill her, holding on sitting behind me (and I only dropped the bike once... at slow speed... we were both unscathed!). Till drove the other, and failed to kill himself or Hannah as well, and we all happily returned just in time for dusk. More on all that in a previous post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day after, our merry band swelled to five when we ran into Marty (he''s in some of those Sabang pictures, as we met him there a couple of days ago and parted ways when he didn''t want to pay 2,000 pesos to sail up to El Nido...), and all of us headed back out to the islands for a so-called island-hopping tour - basically a full day spent on the boat and on the islands, visiting some pretty locations, snorkeling, having lunch, and generally enjoying the beautiful day. Pictures are worth a thousand words (and I don''t want to write a thousand words):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SzOuGHDyPdI/AAAAAAAAIpI/Pg8z2nWqPPc/s1600-h/start.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 225px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SzOuGHDyPdI/AAAAAAAAIpI/Pg8z2nWqPPc/s400/start.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5418866196654210514&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Five of us walking across the shallows towards the boat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SzOuGdbBn9I/AAAAAAAAIpQ/j-B4_P-etik/s1600-h/secret.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SzOuGdbBn9I/AAAAAAAAIpQ/j-B4_P-etik/s400/secret.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5418866202657267666&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;First stop at the Secret Lagoon - a little rock outcropping surrounding a pool about 25 feet squared.

We arrived at 2 o''clock on the dot. So, I''m actually typing this up at the Puerto Princessa airport where I''ve got three hours of free time waiting for my flight. Posting will happen eventually later, as there is a Wi-Fi network here at the airport, but nobody knows the password... Later tonight, I''ll be back in chaotic Manila, and late tomorrow, I should be in Hong Kong! Where first order of business will be arranging my visa to China, but, unfortunately, a close second will be repairing my camera, which got dipped in the salt water during the island-hopping tour... Considering my underwater case is specifically designed for this camera model, and I fully intend to do more diving in Thailand, Burma, and maybe even Hong Kong itself, I am going to find a way to get it fixed.

There is Hong Kong island - the major financial and business center, with its gigantic high-rises, upscale restaurants, and the atmosphere more reminiscent of New York and London than any part of Asia. And this is really what I had expected of Hong Kong. But, there is the other side of the harbor: Kowloon City and Tsim Sha Tsui - this is the busy, bustling, crowded, fragrant (smelly!) part of town on the peninsula that''s connected to mainland China. And it''s connected in more ways than one - it''s unmistakably Asian. From the ''wet markets'' selling fish that''s been caught, but hasn''t been killed yet to the ''No Hawking'' signs on the waterfront, which are quite necessary, as a block away, there are crowds of people trying to sell you anything you can ever imagine. I wouldn''t say wish for, because I don''t actually wish for a suit or a Rolex knock-off, but I keep being offered them anyway... And, of course, at night, both sides of the harbor are brightly lit up putting up a light show of proportions that can only be measured in Megawatts.

Well, the very first impression was that it smells! Or specifically, the rooms I had on my first two nights smelled. Especially the first one, but I arrived at 3 in the morning, so I didn''t care all that much. I promptly moved to a guesthouse in the ubiquitous Chungking Mansions, where my first room also smelled (but less pungently), and by night 3, I was in an odor-free environment! Chunking Mansions itself defies description - it is a 15 story apartment complex, where each apartment has been converted into a hotel/guesthouse - it is the budget accommodation in the city. It is also quite old, home to a variety of small Indian and Pakistani restaurants downstairs, and generally not all that well maintained. The clientele has a smattering of backpackers lost in a sea of mainland tourists and laborers from India, Pakistan, and a wide variety of other British colonies. This evening I ran into a couple from Bogota, Colombia too (who were trying to find an exit...) - it''s kind of like a model UN, except poorly-run former British colonies are over-represented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, I''m quite happy with the room, I''ve finally ended up with - it doesn''t smell, I have a window to the outside world (the previous one had a window also, but I''m not sure what it led to - certainly no the outside though), there''s hot water, and even constant and free internet access, so not all that bad. As for my overall impressions of Hong Kong - oddly enough, I actually found the place rather relaxing and a little lonely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lonely is easy - yes, there''s a gigantic, vibrant mass of people populating this town at all hours of the day and night. And some (probably large) number of them are even fellow backpackers, however, lacking hostels and other such obvious ways of meeting other travelers, they immediately blend in and dissipate into the background, and you''re back on the street surrounded by locals, mainland tourists, and Indians offering fake Rolexes. Fortunately, I was able to solve this problem first by meeting up with Tim (he of wine tasting in Mendoza last March fame), who''s currently in town visiting family, and then further by finding a pickup frisbee game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for relaxing? Well, admittedly, I''m certainly in the minority in finding Hong Kong relaxing, but honestly, my concerns in the Philippines included:&lt;br /&gt; - there''s Malaria on Palawan, have I taken my malaria pills today yet?&lt;br /&gt; - if I have a flight out of Puerto Princessa at 8, and the bus ride there is supposed to take 7 hours, how early should I leave to account for the inevitable delays and breakdowns?&lt;br /&gt; - the traffic in Manila is so bad, that getting to and from the airport requires budgeting a good two hours extra just for the traffic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are potentially difficult problems. Here? The place is tiny - in 7 hours you''d be well into China no matter how many times your bus broke down. The traffic is awful too, but it makes no difference as there''s a very fast and efficient (and relatively inexpensive) subway system in place, not to mention the cross-harbor ferries, which don''t get you there as fast as the subway, but offer reat views of the harbor along the way. The biggest problem here has really been finding a place to stay that I liked, and I had a ready-made choice of 100 or so guesthouses just here in the Chungking Mansions, along with internet recommendations for which ones people have liked before. The runner-up problem is deciding if I should have Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or Indian food for dinner. Maybe it is just me, but I call this relaxing! As for the people persistently trying to sell you something, anything, on the streets (which has been know to annoy people before), I''ve learned to just take it all in stride by now and laugh about the fact that somebody thinks I''m a good candidate to try selling a Rolex and a suit to! It sure beats the army of Nigerians assaulting you with offers of marijuana and every other substance in the world on every street corner in Kathmandu, not to mention the guys in Cartagena, Colombia, who''ll hook you up with a tour, chicas, and cocaina. You decide the order in which you want to prioritize the three! Ok, to be entirely accurate, hashish is on offer here in Hong Kong too, but the would-be sellers, at least, seem a bit surreptitious about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SzeImOfhZ4I/AAAAAAAAIrY/EVOhbC8aHTU/s1600-h/alex.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SzeImOfhZ4I/AAAAAAAAIrY/EVOhbC8aHTU/s400/alex.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5419950866870396802&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Relaxing in Hong Kong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=''1'' height=''1'' src=''https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2883997969551391628-1786123329686197400?l=safety3rd.blogspot.com'' alt='''' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;', NULL, NULL, 'The City of Lights', 'http%3A%2F%2Fsafety3rd.blogspot.com%2F2009%2F12%2Fcity-of-lights.html', 1, 'Alex', NULL, 'Hong Kong', 2, NULL, NULL);

However, I don''t like making that point, and I don''t really know what I''m talking about when it comes to geo-political issues, and it''s not really a true apples-to-apples comparison - after all, The Incas and Aztecs in South America may have been the most advanced local cultures the Spanish had encountered (the Philippines didn''t have much of a developed nation-state prior to the Spanish), whereas the British colonies got to deal with long-established cultures like India, China, and the tribal regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, instead, let''s just say the two European powers took very different approaches to running their colonies, and the results may be most obvious in the Philippines. This is a country in SE Asia, but it may as well be in Latin America. The currency is the peso, the language has a strong Spanish influence to it (mas barato por favor! = cheaper please! both here and in Bolivia...), the names of streets, towns, and people are often Spanish based (Fort Santiago, Puerto Princessa, etc.), and not only is Christianity (Catholicism especially, even though other branches are popping up, probably due to the last 100 years of American colonial influence) the undisputed state religion, the thing I found to be truly surprising was the almost complete absence of Buddhism, in a region where Buddhism dominates all the neighboring states. Islam, by the way, is present down South, stemming from nearby Malaysia and Indonesia, where Islam is the primary religion (even though there''s a lot more signs of Buddhism in both of those countries than there is in the Philippines). The opposing Muslims were apparently quite the annoying discovery to the invading Spanish a few centuries ago, as Spain had just finished fighting off the Muslim forces (the Moors) back in the Spanish homeland and in Northern Africa (this random historical footnote brought to you by Lonely Planet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that''s probably enough geo-political musings and ramblings for the moment. Today is the last of my six here in Hong Kong - tonight I get on a plane bound for the beautiful beaches of Thailand to celebrate New Year''s in style. Goals for today are to find a replacement camera (still! Hong Kong''s been refusing to repair mine...) and meet up with Tim for more delicious local cusine - the food in Hong Kong is excellent as it is, but yesterday he and his parents took me out to a couple of really good local restaurants (that I would have never picked out myself), and the food gets to be even more amazing when you''re with people who know what they are talking about, as opposed to me just randomly pointing at things on a menu!&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=''1'' height=''1'' src=''https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2883997969551391628-1112027835667018039?l=safety3rd.blogspot.com'' alt='''' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;', NULL, NULL, 'Next time you need something colonized', 'http%3A%2F%2Fsafety3rd.blogspot.com%2F2009%2F12%2Fnext-time-you-need-something-colonized.html', 1, 'Alex', NULL, 'Manila, Hong Kong', 2, NULL, NULL);

So, on a rather gloomy and overcast day I made my way up to the Sha Tin Racecourse up in the New Territories to explore the local sporting obsession&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SzwuUsho9FI/AAAAAAAAIuI/z9Omc2oQY8I/s1600-h/sign.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SzwuUsho9FI/AAAAAAAAIuI/z9Omc2oQY8I/s400/sign.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5421258984531752018&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It''s all very royal and British around horse racing here&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SzwuT-yMCgI/AAAAAAAAIt4/N9Xj-uFQBnM/s1600-h/statue.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SzwuT-yMCgI/AAAAAAAAIt4/N9Xj-uFQBnM/s400/statue.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5421258972253129218&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Going into the racecourse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In spite of having lived in the State of Kentucky, which is only slightly less obsessed about horse racing than it is about UK basketball, and even knowing people (ok, a person) involved in the horse racing industry, I''d never actually been to a horse race, so I didn''t really know what to expect, nor I can really compare Hong Kong racing against the American variety. So, basic impressions: I don''t know anything about horse racing, so there are giant tableaus with all kinds of information, but I don''t know what most of it means. As far as the locals seem concerned, there''s really no sport here except for the betting - people barely pay attention to the race itself, but everybody bets and focuses on their stat and information sheets. I didn''t care to bet. I just figured I''d take some pictures, and hopefully some wouldn''t come out totally blurry:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SzwuUZLECLI/AAAAAAAAIuA/VcbzrQwfcUI/s1600-h/warmup.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SzwuUZLECLI/AAAAAAAAIuA/VcbzrQwfcUI/s400/warmup.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5421258979336784050&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Getting ready for the race&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SzwuVMm9CII/AAAAAAAAIuQ/Xuui9Bm0OJ4/s1600-h/turn.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SzwuVMm9CII/AAAAAAAAIuQ/Xuui9Bm0OJ4/s400/turn.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5421258993143974018&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Around the turn they come!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/Szwu0lHl3KI/AAAAAAAAIuY/T9ols5P9tI8/s1600-h/dirt.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/Szwu0lHl3KI/AAAAAAAAIuY/T9ols5P9tI8/s400/dirt.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5421259532299263138&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Down the straightaway towards the finish line!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/Szwu1AEAHlI/AAAAAAAAIug/4k7E100TAFA/s1600-h/slow3.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/Szwu1AEAHlI/AAAAAAAAIug/4k7E100TAFA/s400/slow3.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5421259539531963986&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Now closer to the action, armed with my big lens, I got a few interesting shots&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/Szwu1X1wonI/AAAAAAAAIuo/3xhQzkjkP4A/s1600-h/slow2.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/Szwu1X1wonI/AAAAAAAAIuo/3xhQzkjkP4A/s400/slow2.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5421259545914679922&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Pushing for position to the very end&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three races, I took off to find an ultimate frisbee game in Hong Kong - racing was interesting, but without betting, it doesn''t look like you can really get into it.

Whose schedule I did not know, but figured it would show up soon enough. And the 8 o''clock flight meant there wasn''t much of a rush, so...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Waiting...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is Hong Kong - things run predictably, efficiently, and on schedule. So, after 10 minutes, my double decker bus pulled up to the bus stop, Tim and I exchanged our good-bye''s and I was off to the airport, chatting with a guy on a business trip from the Ivory Coast (that would be a country in West Africa). Sitting on a bus is all about waiting too, but that''s fully expected - if I didn''t want to wait for the bus, I could''ve paid two and a half times as much to take the super-fast and efficient subway and avoid all possibility of traffic delays, but I wasn''t in any hurry, so I waited on the bus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon arriving at the airport, I was initially taken aback by the discovery (or rather non-discovery?) that my 8:05 flight wasn''t on the big Departures board, however, the AirAsia counter was happy to check me in (once I lightened my checked baggage to be reasonably close to 15kg, of course...). Eventually, I found the flight on the Big Board, rescheduled to 8:25... So, a bit more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Waiting...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But waiting at the Hong Kong ariport isn''t all bad - you get free Wi-Fi, comfortable chairs, and a variety of over-priced food options (including the Zakuska restaurant serving caviar... Zakuska is the Russian word for snack)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four hours later, we landed at the Phuket airport in the South of Thailand. I wanted to get to Koh Tao and meet up with friends there. I didn''t have a particularly clear idea of how this was going to happen, but assumed I''d find a way. Step 1 seemed to be to get from the airport to Phuket Town, so I ventured out to be confronted by the swarming hordes of taxi drivers vying for the arriving tourists'' attentions (and cash). After confirming that there was not going to be a bus this evening (in spite of some ten people waiting - for something - at the bus station), I ventured over to the taxi hordes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Where is this share taxi going? (Share taxi is a minivan, which you, obviously, share with others)&lt;br /&gt;- Where do you need to go, sir?&lt;br /&gt;- Where is your taxi going?&lt;br /&gt;- Where do you want to go?&lt;br /&gt;- Phuket City&lt;br /&gt;- Oh no, need a private taxi for that, no van going to Phuket...&lt;br /&gt;- Where are you going then?&lt;br /&gt;- Where do you want to go?&lt;br /&gt;- Are you going to Patong Beach? (I''ve been to Phuket before, I remember some of the geography)&lt;br /&gt;- Yes, five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;- Ok, I''ll go to Patong Beach with you then figure out a way to get to Phuket&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Waiting...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Waiting...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Five minutes, sir...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Waiting... ...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another flight arrives, filled with more backpackers coming from Vietnam. I listen to a group of them go through the same Q and A session with the taxi driver horde. They want to go to Phuket as well, are negotiating a price (I have a 150 Baht ticket for Patong at this point)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Waiting... ...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, the group from Vietnam are at some sort of an indecision point where they seem to have settled on a price, but don''t really know if they are getting ripped off or not, so are hesitating, I confirm that they are in fact trying to get to Phuket, we start talking and eventually they decide to just take the share cab. By the time the four of them, and me, have gotten our tickets for Phuket (Thailand loves giving out tickets for useless things like 30 minute van rides), there''s actually six more people needing to get to Phuket, so we are up to a full van. Apparently, the van is going to Phuket after all...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;30 minutes later, Phuket, center of town. Nine of us have disembarked from the van and are now searching for the next step. The consensus seems to be that buses and vans for Surat Thani, where we all need to get in order to catch the ferries for the island, won''t run till the morning, so we should probably find a place to sleep near the bus station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Waiting... ...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friendly Thai man materializes - I don''t actually know where he came from, but seems to have been there ever since we got out of our taxi. He''s anxious to help - Where do you need to go? You need a hotel? A guesthouse?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Well, we actually need to go to Surat Thani, can you get us there?&lt;br /&gt;- I need to check with my driver&lt;br /&gt;- do you think it''s possible to go tonight?&lt;br /&gt;- sure [at this point I texted the following to twitter: &quot;Just negotiated a middle of the night ride to the coast, i love that anything is possible in this country!&quot; It''s true, anything is possible, but...]&lt;br /&gt;- how much is it goint to be?&lt;br /&gt;- need to check with my driver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So he goes off to look for his driver with one of the guys from the group - a Fin coming from Hong Kong. We discuss how with now 9 of us looking to go (the other two had a hotel reserved in Phuket), anything in the 5,000 Baht range would be reasonable (1 USD ~= 35 THB)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Waiting...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonder what''s taking so long, hope they''re coming back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Waiting... ...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our man is back, with a van, and our Finnish friend - 450 Baht each, we can leave right now. Done! The van is actually surprisingly more comfortable than I expected, and I get some three hours of sleep before we arrive in Surat Thani.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except this time, we are not in the center of town, we are at the offices of a ferry company that can get us to Koh Samui. But I need to go to Koh Tao? Catch another ferry from Samui... What about a direct ferry? (I''m fairly certain there is one). No direct ferry - need to go to Koh Samui.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, reading the guide books while already on the ferry, we learned that there''s a couple of different ferry companies - we got taken to the one that does not have a direct route to Koh Tao (but probably does pay the van service to bring it customers). Being roughly 4 in the morning, I am in no mood to argue or even further investigate, so we get our tickets, for the bus (van), which will take us to the actual ferry, another hour away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Waiting... ...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Suk ar sunrise, departing on the ferry for Koh Samui, after comfirming that the ferry port we just got taken to does not in fact have direct ferries to Koh Tao. Instead they have a 7AM ferry for Koh Samui, arriving there at 8:30AM. They also have ferries from Koh Samui to Koh Tao, departing daily at 3PM, or in the morning at ... wait for it ... 8AM!

By this time, I was starting to keep track of just how long it had been since I had left Hong Kong - after disembarking in Koh Tao, and catching a taxi with Dave and Diana, the last of our group of 11 from the airport, who were going to Koh Tao same as myself, I walked up to Asia Divers Resort right around 3 in the afternoon, on a hot and muggy day in Southern Thailand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S0CDJIvWPQI/AAAAAAAAIwI/2S6md_PFc_g/s1600-h/pooh.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S0CDJIvWPQI/AAAAAAAAIwI/2S6md_PFc_g/s400/pooh.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5422478144342211842&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;An extra passenger on the boat to Koh Tao&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S0CDJTSNmUI/AAAAAAAAIwQ/0X1eJPjpV8k/s1600-h/ferry.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S0CDJTSNmUI/AAAAAAAAIwQ/0X1eJPjpV8k/s400/ferry.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5422478147172800834&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The ferry arrives in Koh Tao. Several hundred tourists, large backpacks at the ready, emerge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Factoring in the time difference, that gave me a total travel time of 23 hours, including a bus, an airport shuttle, an airplane, three different minibuses, three different ferry boats, and one ride in the back of a Toyota truck, masquerading as a taxi on the islands. And then...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Waiting... ...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turns out  Dave and Sandra, the friends I had originally met in Peru back in April and was looking to meet up with here, weren''t actually at Asia Divers Resort (or their actual house five minutes away), as they had taken a boat trip that afternoon, and weren''t due back for another couple of hours. Having Wi-Fi, Thai food, a Thai beer, and no concerns about having to go somewhere else, made the wait a lot easier though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life on Koh Tao:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S0CFBJI67qI/AAAAAAAAIw4/F-yENy1mgBU/s1600-h/fire.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S0CFBJI67qI/AAAAAAAAIw4/F-yENy1mgBU/s400/fire.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5422480206033776290&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;First night on the beach - a fire show&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S0CDJmXgtkI/AAAAAAAAIwY/6XHFlwIR18g/s1600-h/sandra.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S0CDJmXgtkI/AAAAAAAAIwY/6XHFlwIR18g/s400/sandra.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5422478152295298626&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;at the Portabello Restaurant for dinner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S0CDZs0vC9I/AAAAAAAAIwg/FSwiJNILVDc/s1600-h/fizz.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S0CDZs0vC9I/AAAAAAAAIwg/FSwiJNILVDc/s400/fizz.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5422478428906392530&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The very chill Fizz Bar on the beach&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S0CDaD769XI/AAAAAAAAIwo/weKAjPVe7Cg/s1600-h/paul.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S0CDaD769XI/AAAAAAAAIwo/weKAjPVe7Cg/s400/paul.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5422478435110548850&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Paul dazzling us with Russian dance moves.

We had a group of ten of us - Dave, Sandra, myself, and a bunch of friends they''d made traveling around SE Asia the last few months. The boat got us there by about 4:30 in the afternoon, giving us time to get dinner, stock up on alcoholic beverages from a local 7-11 and find a relatively quiet beach to hang out on until hitting the party in earnest around 11.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 11, we made it over to Hat Rin beach, the home of the Full Moon party, which was filled with music, people, fireworks, liquor, and general revelry taken to a number of whole different levels. I had assumed that if I brought my camera with me, I''d either lose it or destroy it (and after finally managing to replace my camera on my last day in Hong Kong, I was looking to avoid those outcomes), so I din''t take any pictures - Karina, however, was a lot more brave, so some visuals of the Blue Moon Party 2009:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S0CCelfNL-I/AAAAAAAAIvA/wiJBcxTgrm8/s1600-h/firesign.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 225px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S0CCelfNL-I/AAAAAAAAIvA/wiJBcxTgrm8/s400/firesign.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5422477413324763106&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S0CCe66a0LI/AAAAAAAAIvI/bcOtyqHEQ5w/s1600-h/firewrks.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 225px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S0CCe66a0LI/AAAAAAAAIvI/bcOtyqHEQ5w/s400/firewrks.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5422477419076047026&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S0CCdxZB0_I/AAAAAAAAIuw/kfML5M35rgM/s1600-h/girls.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 225px;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S0CCdxZB0_I/AAAAAAAAIuw/kfML5M35rgM/s400/girls.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5422477399340209138&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Amelia, Kelly, Sandra, and Karina&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S0CCxqadf5I/AAAAAAAAIvY/6HD1thQ642Y/s1600-h/alex.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 225px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S0CCxqadf5I/AAAAAAAAIvY/6HD1thQ642Y/s400/alex.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5422477741064552338&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sandra, Karina, Dave, and me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S0CCxxNqZpI/AAAAAAAAIvg/7NkcoQrKaL8/s1600-h/gary.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 225px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S0CCxxNqZpI/AAAAAAAAIvg/7NkcoQrKaL8/s400/gary.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5422477742889920146&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Gary and his favorite bucket&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S0CCeOsCMzI/AAAAAAAAIu4/Zf91fs2Psfs/s1600-h/sandave.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 225px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S0CCeOsCMzI/AAAAAAAAIu4/Zf91fs2Psfs/s400/sandave.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5422477407204553522&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sandra and Dave early in the night&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S0CFA13LzkI/AAAAAAAAIww/aFQ9o-I1H4E/s1600-h/girls2.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 225px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S0CFA13LzkI/AAAAAAAAIww/aFQ9o-I1H4E/s400/girls2.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5422480200859110978&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sandra, Kelly, and Karina after a few drinks...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was on the strip in Las Vegas on New Year''s Eve to ring in the new millenium, I''ve been on a cruise-ship over New Year''s, I''ve been to New York''s TIme Square - none of those come even remotely close.

I&acirc;??ve been mostly hanging out in Seattle for the fall and not had exciting stories to share. For Christmas I headed back to Maryland and then up to New York to visit my brother for New Years. I missed the big ball drop in Times Square, but can highly recommend the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nyrr.org/races/2009/r1231x00.asp&quot;&gt;Midnight Run&lt;/a&gt; around Central Park. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning at 3:30 am I left my brother&acirc;??s warm Brooklyn pad and plodded towards the train station. The 20 degree night would have been crisp except for the 50 mph gusts of wind that cut to the bone. I hustled into the LIRR and was whisked to JFK. After a bit of a cluster at the American Airlines ticket counter, I was Miami bound and soundly asleep. Landing in Miami, the bright sunlight got me excited for the week ahead, but the over air conditioned terminal almost convinced not change into the shorts I&acirc;??d stashed in my carry on. Three blissful hours later I was landing in Liberia, Costa Rica. As the waves of warmth and humidity flooded the cabin, I knew I&acirc;??d made the right decision &acirc;?? shorts &acirc;?? and more importantly returning to Tamarindo. I cleared customs and walked outside to find Mattson waiting for me with a taxi, and by 3:30 pm we were on the beach and a world away from my blustery New York morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Returning to a spot where you&acirc;??ve been before is comforting. There&acirc;??s none of the anxiety/adventure of finding a place to stay or an ATM. We already know the best local food is at Red Plastic Chairs, the best happy hour is at Eat@Joe&acirc;??s, and the best way to start your day is bobbing on a surfboard watching the sunrise.

There were 20 divers, along with 5 staff, and the boat''s crew. As soon as we got onboard, it was explained to us that our lives would hereby consist of diving, eating, and sleeping.

I came away thoroughly exhausted - all this diving, combined with sleeping on a boat will do that to you, and I even skipped one of the night dives (there wasn''t much to see at night anyway). Overall, I definitely enjoyed the trip - the downsides are that you do get exhausted, the dive sites are actually somewhat crowded, and I didn''t always see eye-to-eye with my dive guide, even though she was the nicest person in the world... just not the best dive guide I''ve ever been around. As for the crowds, our group of 20 was split up into 5 smaller groups, and we generally tried to stay out of each other''s way. At a few of our dives, we kept running into other groups though, including 20 Japanese divers, all diving together in one group, each with an impressive array of photo and video equipment... On the upside, did I mention 14 dives in four days, including a manta ray, a squid, a leopard shark, snorkeling with a turtle, good company, and being fed (quite deliciously) whenever not in the water? I dare say the upsides more than balance out the downsides! Still, none of the individual dives were as good as Sipidan in Borneo, my favorite dive so far...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And we''ll leave you with this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S1FNerrhMQI/AAAAAAAAIyg/hFU3Q0GYNUU/s1600-h/puppy.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S1FNerrhMQI/AAAAAAAAIyg/hFU3Q0GYNUU/s400/puppy.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427204215474827522&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The cutest creature we saw wasn''t underwater - it was a little puppy that one of the crew had.

I''m pretty sure that the staff just figured putting kids next to a bunch of foreigners would cause them to learn by osmosis... or something along the lines. So the teachers would spend eternities listening to themselves speak, while giving the kids lots of useless rules and regulations. Then they''d release the kids on to us, and get out of the way. We, of course, didn''t have much of an idea what to do, but improvised pretty well, singing songs, playing games (some that even involved some basic English), and generally being silly. The kids all had fun, regardless of whether or not they learned anything, and the teachers seemed to enjoy pawning the kids off onto us, so everybody wins! (i think we had fun too, not that any of us were particularly inclined to actually become teachers afterwards). One of the problem was actually that the kids didn''t really know all that much English, which made explaining things a little tough, so we stuck to simple games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The morning of the second day, the monks showed up, the kids gave them alms (food), and we all troooped up the hill to visit the temple. More endlessly boring instructions ensued from the teachers (in Thai only, so it''s possible they had a sense of humor, and I just missed it, but I doubt it). The monks also lectured/preached, but that seemed a lot more appropriate, since they are, you know, Buddhist monks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S1KF-8nkeFI/AAAAAAAAI0I/Zs2xiHfMMUk/s1600-h/monks.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S1KF-8nkeFI/AAAAAAAAI0I/Zs2xiHfMMUk/s400/monks.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427547817405347922&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Monks passing by the kids&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S1KF_Gx0T1I/AAAAAAAAI0Q/KlI3fXV-b8Y/s1600-h/temple2.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 267px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S1KF_Gx0T1I/AAAAAAAAI0Q/KlI3fXV-b8Y/s400/temple2.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427547820132683602&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Getting closer to the temple&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S1KF_u25g7I/AAAAAAAAI0Y/Qk7K5mUzGj8/s1600-h/temple3.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S1KF_u25g7I/AAAAAAAAI0Y/Qk7K5mUzGj8/s400/temple3.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427547830891414450&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It''s a big, imposing structure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S1KGANYZ3yI/AAAAAAAAI0g/3-P-QKX_09k/s1600-h/adrian.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 266px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S1KGANYZ3yI/AAAAAAAAI0g/3-P-QKX_09k/s400/adrian.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427547839085010722&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Not quite so imposing to keep Adrian and the kids from having a good time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S1KGa5BCSxI/AAAAAAAAI0o/_ivsk4SaE8k/s1600-h/draw.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S1KGa5BCSxI/AAAAAAAAI0o/_ivsk4SaE8k/s400/draw.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427548297474755346&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;After lunch, it was time to draw what we had all seen at the camp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S1KGbF8VmWI/AAAAAAAAI0w/p4Yr_J-jcAM/s1600-h/games.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S1KGbF8VmWI/AAAAAAAAI0w/p4Yr_J-jcAM/s400/games.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427548300944709986&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And play a few more games - Monika and I educated/entertained with a cross between hang man and pictionary.

My two and a half day stay in Bangkok this time happened to fall on the weekend, and the Soidawgz (the Bangkok frisbee team) even decided to move the pickup game from Sunday to Saturday afternoon to accommodate me (well, it may have had something to do with the army needing the field on Sunday too...). So, I made my way over to the fields for some three hours of running around in the heat, fully expecting a background serenade of gun fire again. Sadly, the Thai military has apparently relocated the firing range, so, still plenty of troops marching all around us, but not gun fire this time. Frisbee was still a lot of fun - starting to justify dragging the cleats around the world with me. If any of the people from 18 months ago were still there, I failed to recognize them, but they didn''t seem to have any trouble accepting me anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond frisbee, Bangkok was more of a business trip this time - I got my visa to Burma, my plane ticket to Yangon, tried (and failed) to get my laptop''s keyboard repaired (it now comes with a little roll-up pink USB keyboard) and did get my sandals repaired.

Well, there''s plenty of ways, of course. My favorite at the moment centers on Burma (or call it Myanmar if you like). In 2003, the G.W. Bush administration declared a trade embargo against Burma - probably sensible, the country is being run by a highly oppressive military junta. Result: no trade with America, so no American companies can operate here (this, sadly includes all credit card companies and ATM networks!). Unintended ironic consequence: the country''s currency has effectively switched to the US dollar. Pain in the ass for a tourist: need to estimate how much money Burma will cost, get that in crisp new dollar bills in Bangkok, and bring it with you. Otherwise, no money. Secondary annoying consequence: my cell phone doesn''t work, I presume because it''s ATT, and American company, and they''re not allowed to do business here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;[un] fair trade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I upgraded my Burma guide book back in Bangkok - I had arrived with a guide book in Spanish, which I had ordered by mistake, but figured it was better than nothing, and it was, marginally. In Bangkok, I traded it, along with a few other books I had finished, for a nice new English guide book. I felt a little guilty momentarily when I suspected that the lady running the shop didn''t realize that my guidebook was actually in Spanish, not just an older English edition. My guilt quickly dissipated when I opened my ''new'' guidebook and realized it''s just a very well made photo copy. Incredibly well made, admittedly - properly bound, with all the color photos in the right places and I suspect with the outside cover siphoned from the original factory. But the inside pages are all photo copies. And I''m OK with that, actually - it has everything I need. But it certainly isn''t a brand new original edition, so she deserves her Spanish guide book - karma!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Skies over Burma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adding to my list of exotic airlines: Myanmar International Airways for the flight from Bangkok to Yangon. Actually, a perfectly nice airline, and due to local Asian form, they insist on giving us a meal over the course of the flight, which was barely over an hour in duration. First impressions of Burma upon arrival in Yangon? It''s every bit as poor and destitute as you hear - most buildings seem rather dilapidated, while the cars (primarily Toyotas and Mazdas) are uniformly ancient and are in various states of disrepair. The people are every bit as nice as I had heard. At one point, while I was trying to find my hotel, wandering around the streets, a lady (with an iPhone, which I also found astounding) insisted on walking me there. Everybody else on the street had tried to help as well, they just weren''t that good at it, since the locals don''t need hotels a whole lot, I presume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;As for the unexpected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burma is positioned right between Thailand and India. And it shows as the way the people look, dress, and act all seems like a combination of the two cultures (I couldn''t, of course, tell you how much of this is natural and how much is due to the British, former colonial masters, bringing a lot of Indian laborers over, in their infinite wisdom, but the result is unmistakable). One thing that India and Thailand do have in common however is that both drive on the British (wrong, i.e. left) side of the road. Burma? We drive on the right (as in American) side here! Even though every car I''ve seen so far has the steering wheel on the right. This seems like one of those snap decisions by the military junta in charge of the place - &quot;starting tomorrow, you will all drive on the right side! Done!&quot; Maybe they''re just trying to get closer with China, the other major neighboring nation, but so far they don''t seem to have a whole lot in common, other than the side of the road on which they drive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS.

The king, who inherited supernatural powers as a result of his birth to a &lt;b&gt;zawgyi&lt;/b&gt; (an accomplished alchemist) father and &lt;b&gt;naga&lt;/b&gt; (dragon serpent) princess, found the rock at the bottom of the sea. Upon its miraculous arrival at the mountain top, the boat used to transport the rock then turned to stone.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, naturally, I figured I should go see this Golden Rock of legend for myself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S1myWDau5hI/AAAAAAAAI3E/HAyASC0VJs8/s1600-h/rock.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 267px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S1myWDau5hI/AAAAAAAAI3E/HAyASC0VJs8/s400/rock.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5429566917716141586&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Rock at sunrise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To see said rock, you get on a bus in Yangon in the morning, spend a fairly uncomfortable six hours onboard, them disembark at the town on Kinpun to spend a more uncomfortable 45 minutes in the back of a truck going up the mountain, just as soon each and every one of the 48 seats in the back is filled (or, technically speaking, paid for). Then, of course, you have the final 45 minute climb to the top on foot (half way was my hotel - I chose to leave most of my things down in Kinpun). On the way up you see idyllic drawings of what things must''ve looked like a hundred year ago - a tiny dirt path winding its way up the mountain, with the Golden Rock serving as a lighthouse at the end. Capitalism has put a quick end to all the idyllic settings - the mountain is still here, and is still surrounded by lush greenness. The path, however, is now paved and surrounded by shops, restaurants, and guesthouses (for locals only - foreigners can stay for cheap in Kinpun, or if you want to see sunset/sunrise, you have exactly 3 choices on the mountain, all priced accordingly to the lack of competition). So after all this adventure, I arrived at the top at about 5:30 in the afternoon for the 5:45 sunset, and again early the next morning for sunrise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S1myWWAJdaI/AAAAAAAAI3U/X-MaHjkvhxs/s1600-h/sun.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S1myWWAJdaI/AAAAAAAAI3U/X-MaHjkvhxs/s400/sun.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5429566922704909730&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sun starting to head down as I was heading up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S1mx9h6_uOI/AAAAAAAAI28/ZnazYbpPzio/s1600-h/rock++open.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S1mx9h6_uOI/AAAAAAAAI28/ZnazYbpPzio/s400/rock++open.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5429566496407795938&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The rock in the fading dusk light - I figured framing it with empty space was better than the shops and gaudy temples on the other side&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S1myWGwIkTI/AAAAAAAAI3M/1IgIMMGCq_0/s1600-h/rockalex.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 267px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S1myWGwIkTI/AAAAAAAAI3M/1IgIMMGCq_0/s400/rockalex.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5429566918611210546&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Admittedly, the rock is nicely lit up at night&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S1mx9b7gcbI/AAAAAAAAI20/8l-lZ8UW_5w/s1600-h/friends.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S1mx9b7gcbI/AAAAAAAAI20/8l-lZ8UW_5w/s400/friends.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5429566494799327666&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Dinner at the peak with Roman (Swiss) and his girlfriend, Nun (Thai), the only other foreigners on the full bus from Yangon. Burma is definitely not Thailand when it comes to tourism&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the next morning, after getting up, oh 5 in the morning, to witness sunrise, we all headed back down the mountain and climbed back aboard the bus (this one said it was the Radisson Hotel Narita Airport - I like that Burma doesn''t even bother repainting the buses it gets from Japan, as donations, I presume). I was headed for Inle Lake, Roman and Nun were trying to get to Mandalay - we both had to change buses in the town of Bago, where we had a couple of hours to explore while waiting for the next bus. A quick scan of the guidebook and the tourist advertising at the bus station told us there was a giant reclining Buddha within easy walking distance. It also came with a legend of its very own:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Once upon a time a nasty king, who went by the name of Mgadeikpa, ruled the lands around what is today Bago. His reign was marked by corruption and violence &lt;/i&gt;[kinda like the current government...]&lt;i&gt;, but one day his son was out hunting in the forest when he came upon a village of Suvannabhumi, where his eye fell upon a Mon girl who caused his heart to flutter. Even though she was a Buddhist and he, like everyone in his father''s kingdom, worshipped pagan idols, the two became lovers and married after he promised her that she could continue to practice Buddhism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back at the court the king was furious when he discovered this and ordered both the girl and his son executed. Yet, when the new bride prayed in front of the pagan idol it cracked and broke. The king was seized with fear, and realizing the error of his ways, he ordered a statue of the Buddha to be built and the population to convert to Buddhism&lt;/i&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, we headed for the Buddha, and half an hour later, came upon an appropriately huge and gaudy reclining deity:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S1mx9KWDc2I/AAAAAAAAI2s/l81PKJ7Zfbo/s1600-h/buddha.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 225px;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S1mx9KWDc2I/AAAAAAAAI2s/l81PKJ7Zfbo/s400/buddha.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5429566490078835554&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Well, it''s the biggest reclining Budha, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;''ve ever seen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending 20 minutes marveling at the giant deity (and trying to ignore Ton Ton, who was really intent on selling us on a tour of Bago), we headed back to grab some lunch and catch our respective buses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the luxury of 16 unoccupied hours that followed before I arrived at Inle, I reviewed the guidebook some more, and, sadly, discovered that we had photographed the wrong Buddha - the one we found is Naung Daw Gyi Mya Tha Lyaung, built in 2003. The ancient one we were looking for is the Shwethalyaung Buddha, half a block further. Ahh Burma, where every street corner has a gold-domed pagoda or a gigantic reclining Buddha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Don''t you love that all the sights in Burma come with their very own legends?

It also has the unique distinction of lacking any actual shoreline - the water slowly morphs into reeds, and tall grass, and marsh-like areas, and eventually, voila, dry land!

But equipped with a 300mm zoom lens, I set off documenting said every day life, with the long zoom allowing me to feel mildly less intrusive\r&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/lake.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 409px; height: 273px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/lake.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427629187558193650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The definitive view of Inle - the lake, the mountains, and a lone fisherman paddling a canoe along, with his leg(!)\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/fish.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 409px; height: 273px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/fish.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427629187558193650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This fisherman choosing to use his arms to paddle - so much less picturesque!\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/lady.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 409px; height: 273px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/lady.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427629187558193650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A lady piloting her boat along, hidden beneath the wide brims of her hat\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/many.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 401px; height: 225px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/many.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427629187558193650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Not really sure what this was all about, but these guys were &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; rowing their boats along in the morning.

There are, but now that I''m in Bagan, unless you built your temples by the thousand, you might as well not have bothered building at all!\r&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/alex.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 401px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/alex.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427629187558193650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Well, Inn Dein, a short canal ride away from Inle, actually comes pretty close, supposedly sporting 1054 Zedi (the pointy-things behind me) on top of a hill. Bagan still scoffs at you, Inn Dein!\r&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;So, if Inle Lake can be descibed as ''interesting,'' the word that comes to mind for the Bagan Plain is ''jaw dropping'' (ok, so, it''s two words). The bus ride from Inle to Bagan can, incidentally, be best described as jaw-shattering. During that bumpy ride, I did, however, manage to read a bit of my guide book, learning that the old Bamar Kings had built over 4,400 temples in Bagan over the course of about 230 years (before getting properly beaten down by the Mongols, of course...) to remind the population that they were all Buddhists now, I suppose. Upon reading that, I figured I''d see a few dozen restored temples, and the rest would be piles of rock, sort of like the Inca ruins in Peru, where some archaeologist has authoritatively stated that every single rock you come across is actually an integral part of an Inca Temple... Well, I was wrong:\r&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/bagan.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 401px; height: 225px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/bagan.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427629187558193650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The plain of Bagan is quite literally filled with thousands of temples - still standing, restored, it''s hard to tell the difference, but all unmistakably amazing\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/stuppas.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 401px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/stuppas.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427629187558193650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Golden domes hiding behind brick domes, as far as the eye can see\r&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;So, naturally, the first thing I did upon arriving in Bagan was ... leave. Well, I didn''t &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; live, I just ran into Heinrich and Martina, a Norwegian couple, on my first morning in Bagan, and decided to go with them to Mt. Popa. I''d been hoping to see Mt. Popa anyway, but it''s about 50km away, so you have to go with a taxi of some sorts, and having people there already to share the costs with was enough to convince me, so off we went\r&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/popa.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 273px; height: 409px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/popa.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427629187558193650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Mt. Popa, an extinct volcano, rising in the background.\r&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;We made a little detour on the way too, stopping to see the locals harvest palm trees and make palm juice, beer, and distill a spirit, which is 45% alcohol by volume... Not the most awful moonshine I''ve ever tasted either. The mountain itself was highlighted by the monkeys, who inhabit the stairwells leading up, and the nats, who inhabit the temples on and around the mountain. The nats are basically guardian spirits - pre-Buddhist era deities, which were kept around just in case. My favorite was the patron saint of gamblers (who gets whiskey bottles as offerings) - clearly, if you''re going to get started in cock fighting, you might as well have your bases covered, since I''m not sure Buddha himself has ever revealed his true feelings on the subject.\r&lt;br /&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;Bagan, Day 2: Bring on the temples in full force! I got up, rented a bike, picked up a detailed map, and headed off, camera at the ready. I only returned after the sun had set.

There is a few temples that you can scale and join a couple dozen other tourists gazing away at the spectacle of the sun coming up and down over the horizon.

But it''s the crowds of souvenir hawkers that really start to wear on you (the locals are clearly keenly aware that Bagan is the prime tourist attraction of their country). So, at about 2 in the afternoon, feeling like I had dodged the crowds enough to see all the temples I had wanted to see, I felt ready to head back and relax for an afternoon. But then I spotted this guy, while at Dhamma-ya-za-ka Zedi\r&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/last.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 409px; height: 273px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/last.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427629187558193650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I was intrigued...\r&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r&lt;br /&gt;The temple was clearly huge, and I was making a point to hit most of the big ones, but they were generally specially marked on my map, and attracted throngs of tourists. This one I was having trouble identifying and couldn''t see anyone there. So, I hopped back on the bike and headed in the general direction trying to navigate the sandy goat paths, and remaining glad that I had chosen to pay extra for a proper mountain bike, with its thick spiky tires, and 7 gears. After 15 minutes of traversing the worst goat-paths yet, I arrived, and was greeted by the glorious sounds of ... silence! I had the place (Pya-tha-da Pagoda, as I later identified it by triangulating my position relative to the other big temples I could see) all to myself. No tourists, no salespeople, no shady ruby dealers, no kids following you around the whole temple, offering some postcards (or a copy of Orwell''s Burma Days), just Buddha sitting there, in glorious, serene, meditative silence. I was starting to feel like I could relate to Buddha... After making a circle through the temple''s interior, I emerged, ready to head home, but now I finally saw somebody stir in the nearby shade - ahh, I wasn''t alone after all... I was ready to ignore the man, but instead of coming up to ask &quot;Where you come from?&quot; (the de facto tourist greeting around these parts), he just called out &quot;You want to go?&quot; I had to think about this for a moment, but soon enough the image of the closed off staircase popped into my head\r&lt;br /&gt; - go up?\r&lt;br /&gt; - yes\r&lt;br /&gt; - yes, definitely!\r&lt;br /&gt;So, in summary, Pya-tha-da actually got better at this point, when the gatekeeper let me up onto the roof. Not showing any desire to sell me anything in the process, nor to find out where I come from... In fact, the only desire I was able to discern was to lock the staircase back up after I was done, head back to his spot in the shade, and go back to napping. I liked the guy, and his temple!&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=''1'' height=''1'' src=''https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2883997969551391628-9068746324249287431?l=safety3rd.blogspot.com'' alt='''' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;', NULL, NULL, 'Inle & Bagan', 'http%3A%2F%2Fsafety3rd.blogspot.com%2F2010%2F01%2Finle-bagan.html', 1, 'Alex', NULL, 'Inle Lake,Bagan', 2, NULL, NULL);

So, let me know if this works!&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;Demographics is just more random tourist observations - in general the greatest numbers of travelers I&amp;#39;ve met have come from the UK, Holland, Australia, Sweden, Ireland, and Israel. In Burma, I met one group from Israel, a Dutch guy, and noone from the other countries above. Instead, I met some Belgians, Norwegians, French, Spanish, Russians, Danes, a few Americans, Japanese, Koreans, and even Italians - I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;d ever met Italian travelers before. And the Russians here were the first Russian tourists I had met traveling to a place that wasn&amp;#39;t a beach resort/diving destination. Of course it is Burma, so the sample size is quite small and most of the travelers here aren&amp;#39;t backpackers, but still, it&amp;#39;s odd. It may have something to do with the fact that there&amp;#39;s some organizations who actively discourage tourism to Burma as a way to oppose the military junta government, and this movement is largely based out of England, but, still, no English? Very odd...&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The picture included is a funny-looking statue from Mandalay, with a little army of smaller guys following him...

First, there''s the maniacal Burmese drivers - the traffic here is seemingly devoid of all rules and regulations. Your only cue is to simply go with the flow. The driving is aggressive, but not reckless - you constantly have to be aware of where everyone else is, and to some extent, have to be able to anticipate what they will do, which is why the safest way to go is to drive as they do, so you can be predictable. You don''t stop - stationary objects remain stationary in this system, while traffic flows around them. Merging, turning, passing, you just keep going with the flow, and dodge the crossing traffic, fortunately you are never alone in what you are trying to do. It''s a lot like the traffic in India in its Lone Ranger, Last Man Standing Wins sort of way, except the overall flow of traffic is actually a bit faster (a scary thought - Indian traffic moving even faster...), as there are no cows or infernal push carts blocking the roads. It also doesn''t quite have as much reckless, ''Ah, what''s my life really worth?'' feel to it - everyone is paying attention. There are no soccer moms here - in the time it would take to quell the four kids in the back of the Suburban, the front grille would''ve collected a half dozen bikers and motorcyclists... The traffic is made up of cars, trucks, and an inordinate number of bikes and motorcycles scurrying in and out between them, never stopping...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, aggressive, I can do. Half an hour in, I was zipping in and out of traffic with the locals, giving a wave to the occasional tourist on a bicycle or in the back of a taxi mini-truck, operating the horn with near-local precision: short half beep means ''I''m here - FYI,'' while the long, loud beep means ''Get out of my way, inferior creature!'' (all who are smaller or same size, but slower than you, are by definition inferior and are expected to clear out of the way). The clutch/gear box and I still had an occasional disagreement, but we worked on our differences, and all came out better for the experience. Well, I did anyway, and I don''t think I caused any damage to the gear box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second obstacle, which is complicated by the first, is that you don''t know where you are going. I eventually learned that the big road for Yangon would pass through Paleik. Where? How? Would I see the snakes hovering over the pagoda to mark the spot when I got there? Noone knew, so I went... and started asking for directions (remembering India and trying to avoid Yes and No questions - &quot;Sir, Yes, sir!&quot;). When three indepenent people agree on a direction, you are probably going the right way, just need to figure out where the next [totally unmarked] turn is going to be. I felt I was uniquely prepared for this challenge as well, so I went - bring it on, Burma! I left the motorcycle shop at about 9:20. The snakes get fed and bathed in Paleik daily a 11, so that was my goal. The guide book claims the bus can get you there in about 45 minutes... I figured I was doing OK. After a few ''exploratory'' detours, and some helpful directions from a monk, I stumbled upon Yadana Labamuni Hsu-taung-pye Paya (Snake Pagoda for short) at precisely 11:03, feeling rather surprised to have found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/snakealex.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 409px; height: 273px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/snakealex.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427629187558193650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Yup, I got there just in time for the bathing and tourist picture taking. Feeding would''ve been cool to see too, but no feeding today.

The monks are more than happy to take care of them, as snakes do feature pretty prominently in general Buddhist mythology, so it''s made quite the rock star out of the previously unknown little pagoda in Paleik. Whether or not the three I saw were the original three pythons I do not know, but snakes do live a long time, especially with no predators and daily baths at the temple, so they may well be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The snakes built up an appetite for me, so after surprising a street side local restaurant by having a foreigner pop in for lunch, I headed off for Inwa. I was actually trying to get to Amarapura, but Inwa was on the way, so I went through it.

The first few moments getting through the Mandalay traffic were pretty intense, but after that? I''ve done worse... It''s not like it''s driving around the 6-lane roundabouts in downtown Paris!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was my second day in Mandalay. On the first day here, I also left the city, taking an hour-long river cruise up the Ayeyarwady River to the town of Mingun (Mandalay itself, as you may have guessed isn''t as interesting as its surroundings). This had two major goals - I wanted to get out on the river a little bit, since I missed out on taking the boat up here from Bagan, and I wanted to see Mingun, famed for its gigantic, albeit unfinished, Paya (pagoda)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/river.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 409px; height: 273px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/river.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427629187558193650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Out on the river&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/mingun.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 409px; height: 273px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/mingun.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427629187558193650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Mingun Paya was supposed to be &lt;b&gt;three&lt;/b&gt; times the size of the current (already towering) structure, but King Bodwpaya, whose pet project this was, died in 1819, after 30 years of work had brought it ''only'' to the current stage, and noone has picked up the slack since&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/alexmingun.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 401px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/alexmingun.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427629187558193650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Other sights in Mingun - the white-washed Settawya Paya&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/taxi.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 409px; height: 273px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/taxi.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427629187558193650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And this is the Mingun taxi service. Note that it does actually say ''Taxi'' on the side of the wagon... I chose not to partake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few other notes of interest from Mingun:&lt;br /&gt; - the Mingun Bell is the largest un-cracked cast iron bell in the world. The sign here acknowledges that the King Bell in the Kremlin in Moscow is larger, but the Russian one is cracked. This one is not, even after falling off of its supports during an earthquake in 1838. The same eathquake is also responsible for that extra large crack you might spot on the left side of the Mingun Paya&lt;br /&gt; - next to the bell is the Molmi Paya, dedicated to a Buddhist scholar who is in the Guiness World Book of Records for reciting all 16,000+ pages of Buddhist scriptures, in their entirety, in 1954. From memory! Impressive... A statue of the scholar occupies the center of the Paya and is, appropriately enough, adorned with a pair of reading glasses.&lt;br /&gt; - while waiting for my boat back to Mandalay, I tried a glass of the local Spirulina beer - the anti-aging beer! The next day, with my hat mischieviously backwards, and a big python in my hands, I don''t look a day over eighteen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mingun excursion doesn''t take all that long, so the boat got us all back to Mandalay around 2:30, which, I figured was plenty of time to complete my pilgrimage to the three most revered Buddhist sights in Burma: Yangon''s Shwedagon Pagoda, the Golden Rock on Mount Kyaiktiyo, and Mandalay''s very own (ok, seized from Mrauk U in Rakhaing State, but if they really wanted to keep it, they should''ve fought harder!)

Not because this is Sunday Mass or anything, no, no, it''s just 5 o''clock on a Friday. Same as any other time, any other day, I''m pretty certain. The people love their Mahamuni Buddha! And I was trying not to make &lt;i&gt;too much&lt;/i&gt; of a nuisiance out of myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that''s just about it for both Mandalay and Burma - tomorrow morning I''ll have just enough time to climb Mandalay Hill and get some [hopefully clear] views from up there, before packing up and heading for the airport to catch my flight to Kunming, China, where this current adventure is set to continue - hope I still remember how to use my ATM card!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* ''Last Stand,'' of course, refers mostly to Mandalay being my final stop in Burma.

None are here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, the airport is the microchosm for the state of Myanmar today - even when the government sinks a bunch of money into doing something right, it still goes wrong because nobody wants to deal with the government. For one thing, the airport is an astounding 25 miles outside of town - that''s further away than any of the towns I had visited the day before, so not quite a suburb. When I walked in, I found an entire, dimly lit, hall full of checkin counters. One (and only one!) of the, at least, twelve was occupied by my flight - China Eastern Airlines to Kunming, processing the forty odd passengers very slowly. Then the plane was late and I got to wonder what would happen if my flight got canceled - my finances were down to about $30 and $10 worth of Burmese currency, but the plane arrived, parking a loooong way away from the terminal. Maybe because it was Chinese. Maybe it''s just the way we do things. Maybe because it was a jet - there were two other planes at the airport at the time, both propeller driven, neither showing any plans to fly; there couldn''t have been any more flights scheduled for another 3-4 hours at least... if at all that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually, we did all get onboard and depart though. I being the only Westerner on board (and getting English-language instructions all to myself). Everyone in Burma, whom I told that I wasn''t leaving via Yangon - local and tourist alike - had been astounded. I don''t think tourists know that there''s an international flight out of Mandalay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An hour an a half later, communist China greeted me. It''s so Communist that the first thing I did upon landing was go to an ATM, a seemingly rather Capitalist symbol... There''s galso a Walmart a five minute walk down from my hostel. I''ve been in China for four days now - haven''t really done much, I''ve been focused on getting my trip to Tibet sorted out, and I now have, flying up there early Friday morning. I''ve also learned how to circumvent China''s filters just enough to be able to occasionally post... The other thing that struck me about China was that the time was all wrong. At the end of January, sunset is after 7PM, while sunrise is at almost 8AM. I like this schedule actually (except for the persistent bitter cold in the morning) since I''m more likely to be up late at night than up early in the morning, but it is odd. It''s just what you get when you give the country the size of China a single time zone, centered on Beijing, of course. So, Kunming, some 2,000 miles West gets to be a little screwy. In this sense, China is still perfectly Communist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few pictures from China:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/temple.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 401px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/temple.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427629187558193650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Yuantong Temple in Kunmiing.

It''s actually a somewhat daunting place as you start at 3,800m, and then end up climbing all those stairs to the top, but it''s certainly worth the effort! Inside, it''s filled with a variety of relics and memorabilia from the Kings and Dalai Lamas who used to occupy the place bafore the Chinese ''liberation''... But, unfortunately, there''s to be no photography inside, so you''ll just have to take my word that the golden stuppas and statues inside are awe-inspiring. Side note: paintings can actually be damaged by repeated exposure to flash, yet you can take all the pictures you want in the Louvre, Golden statues, as far as I can tell, are relatively immune to photography, yet the Potala is just one of many places that bans photography. Occasionally, such as in Burma, it has more to do with religious beliefs and traditions, but in Communist-''liberated'' Chinese Tibet? &amp;lt;rant over&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Potala can actually be easily split up into two parts - the White Palace,built in the 7th century, and the Red Palace, added in the 12th century. One of the things that I found the most amazing about the place is that the White Palace was completed in just five(!) years back in the 7th century. Which strikes me as incredibly rapid, considering the immense dimensions of the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the Tibet architecture I did not find quite so awe-inspiring. The buildings tend to be squat and feature thick walls to try and protect against the frigid climates.

Well, especially the ones who speak some English - I''ve made friends with Permitsering, who had been a monk for 10 years, but has since left his monastery and is now learning English and aiming to become a guide - a fascinating fellow, who will certainly make a better guide than the girl we had for parts of the trip.

For however long it takes to get to where you are going - food is strictly whatever turns up, often as charity, and sleeping is as often as not just there on the road, wrapped up in a blanket, braving the seriously sub-zero temperatures... Amazing - these people take their religion awfully seriously!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then, of course, there''s the New Year. Chinese New Year falls on Feruary 14th this year. The Tibetans also use the lunar calendar, so you might think Tibetan New Year would coincide with Chinese New Year - you''d be wrong, usually, except for this year, when they do coincide. I agree, it''s all very confusing. So how do you celebrate a New Year? Why, with fireworks, of course! And if you want to imagine what fireworks in Lhasa look like, you first have to forget everything you know about fireworks back home. That nice, big, well-organized display put on by the city is here too, but in addition everyone on the street becomes an amature firework operator. For the past two nights I''ve had a chance to survey the scene from rooftops, and it is simply amazing - there are fireworks going off everywhere you look! Some, simple firecrackers on the street, others, huge displays getting fired off into the air. I understand setting off fireworks is supposed to bring good luck in the coming year, so the more and bigger, the merrier! And this goes on for a good hour! The military, to their credit, doesn''t seem too inclined to interfere - there are soldiers with fire blankets and fire extinguishers posted all over, but they seem to just be there in the roles of backup fire fighters, if something goes wrong (or so I''m guessing. The locals, I suspect, would prefer that the soldiers were engulfed in a few of the flames...). Pictures simply can''t do the display justice, so I don''t have any - this is one of those things you''d just have to experience for yourself!&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=''1'' height=''1'' src=''https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2883997969551391628-490813605929135325?l=safety3rd.blogspot.com'' alt='''' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;', NULL, NULL, 'Tibet 101', 'http%3A%2F%2Fsafety3rd.blogspot.com%2F2010%2F02%2Ftibet-101.html', 1, 'Alex', NULL, 'Lhasa', 2, NULL, NULL);

So, your basic Communist China bureaucracy at work - not sure to what end, as they are not actually preventing tourists from seeing Tibet, just making it difficult enough to drive down the numbers (and revenues), but I''m sure there''s a grand plan to all of this somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I arrived in Lhasa with a permit allowing me to spend exactly four days in Tibet, specifically in Lhasa - this obviously wouldn''t do, so I immediately set off in search of other tourists, with whom I would band together to get out of the capital and see more of this vast, fascinating country. All this to the great chagrin of my tour agency, who, I suspect, could get into trouble if I had overstayed my permit. And I had no intention of leaving, so I suppose they had reason to worry. What makes things complicated is that it''s cold here in Tibet in February, so there''s not a lot of tourists - were this equally frigid Nepal, there''d still be plenty of people, but this is Chinese Tibet...

Side note: all meals in Tibet, outside of Lhasa, consist of noodles and yak meat. Sometimes, you get a menu, other times, you go into the kitchen and point, but the result is always the same. And it is delicious, mind you, but after four days I was looking for a bit of variety back in Lhasa. Lhasa features such exotic varieties as chicken, spaghetti, and Indian food... The conversation over dinner briefly touched on the subject of abortion, which we quickly skirted around, but the subject returned rather unfortunately the following morning, when we were informed by our tour agency''s manager that the trip to Everest was going to have to be aborted! Apparenty, another two hundred kilometers West, the weather was quite different - the passes were snowed in, there was no visibility anyway, and the police had closed down the roads. We met three Dutch girls, whose car had attempted the trip a day earlier, before the roads had been closed down, and they seemed rather shaken by the experience on the icy roads - they also didn''t actually get to see the mountain. The weather was predicted to remain for over a week, so we reluctantly had to admit that we wouldn''t be seeing Everest this time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Day 1, we were following the same route as another car heading for Everest. In fact, I had met the people in that car earlier, and they were the back-up plan, if the Australians hadn''t turned up. As we later learned, that other car chose to just spend a day sight-seeing in Shigatse - there''s apparently an important monastery here, where the early Dalai Lamas had resided. Tibetan monasteries are all more or less the same though, so staying in Shigatse seemed unacceptably boring to us (besides, that other car just wasn''t that cool), so we instead got our guide and driver on board to visit Nam Tso lake - supposedly the highest lake in the world, at an altitude of 4351 meters. The guidebooks spoke very highly of it, and even though it''d be frozen over in February, it still promised a spectacular site. And it was only a day''s worth of driving away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The frozen alpine lake did not dissappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/flagslake.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 402px; height: 226px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/flagslake.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427629187558193650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Nam Tso, flanked by some 7,000+ meter peaks.

Now, all the guesthouses were closed, so we headed back to the nearby town of Damxung for the night, passing more tall snow-capped peaks on the way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the lake worked out to be an excellent backup plan to Everest. No signs of the inclement weather showed up here, and apparently, our permits that stated Everest as our destination were good enough for Nam Tso as well. All attractions in Tibet, including Nam Tso and Everest come with an entrance fee, which I wouldn''t feel all that bad about if the money didn''t go straight back to Beijing... to return in the form of infrastructure imprvements, I suppose, which the Tibetans would like prefer to do without, if it meant independence... But that''s a side note. Back on the lake, the only real problem at this time of year is the bitter cold, excerbated by the never-abating winds - it is early February at 4,300 meters above sea level after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/cold.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 402px; height: 301px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/cold.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427629187558193650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So, that''s me, fully bundled up, yet still a bit chilly at the lake.

More on those in the previos post - a little follow-up from this morning: today is the actual New Year''s Day, both Chinese and Tibetan. It is a little similar to Christmas back home - most shops and restaurants are closed. Today was my designated souvenir shopping day, and I did manage to get what I wanted (somebody is always selling things to tourists in places like this), but the variety was decidedly more limited today than before. Lunch ended up in a Muslim restaurant (still featuring noodles and yak meat, of course) - I''ve been a bit surprised to learn that there''s a sizeable Muslim community here in Lhasa. For dinner, the owners of our hostel have apparently found a Chinese restaurant that''s open - just like Christmas back home. Also like Christmas, the people go to church, en masse. Except in this case, &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt; comes to Lhasa to visit the Johkang Temple. This is a very large place, and the line to enter wrapped all the way around! I''d have to guess it would take at least three hours to enter the place - nobody seemed to mind. New Year is also apparently the time for new clothes in Tibet, so everyone on the streets was sporting their brand new Sunday best. Conveniently enough, the New Year actually was on a Sunday this time around, so welcome to the Year of the Tiger!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An addendum: I can''t believe these facinating Tibetan people stole my fucking jacket! No, I can''t help but keep being reminded of Cyrus'' post about his &lt;a href=&quot;http://safety3rd.blogspot.com/2008/08/bastards-stole-my-granola-bars.html&quot;&gt;granola bars getting stolen&lt;/a&gt; in Kazakhstan. And yes, it would''ve been much less likely to be stolen if I didn''t have most of my attentions squarely focused on the very cute Tibetan girl I''d made friends with earlier that evening. And it wasn''t even a nice jacket, considering that Buster had bought it back in Kathmandu and given to me in New Zealand, with both of us rather astonished that famed Nepalese quality had lasted quite that long... It is sort of approriate that the jacket should make its way back to the Himalayas to perhaps remain there, I suppose, but that thought fails to make me feel any better (or warmer). Especially considering that instead of the money someone had apparently hoped I''d keep in my jacket, I had my gloves, hat, and ear-muffs in there. And I get the feeling I''ll still very much miss those even after I pick up another cheap jacket of questionable quality at the next available opportunity... Well, I still like you, Tibetans - we didn''t have to pay for any of our drinks that night on the bright side - but you are trying my patience!&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=''1'' height=''1'' src=''https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2883997969551391628-6782842140275758380?l=safety3rd.blogspot.com'' alt='''' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;', NULL, NULL, 'Everest... aborted!', 'http%3A%2F%2Fsafety3rd.blogspot.com%2F2010%2F02%2Feverest-aborted.html', 1, 'Alex', NULL, 'Shigatse,Lhasa,Damxung', 2, NULL, NULL);

This is also first and foremost an archaelogical site, so you generally can''t just walk up to a warrior for a photo op.

It was the fact that everybody goes to travel over the two week holiday - be it visit family, or go sight-seeing, everybody goes, and all the transport is full. I had by now decided that I was ready to leave China behind and booked a ticket out of Shanghai to Taiwan, so this left the small matter of getting to Shanghai... The trains were booked out for seven days in advance, I didn''t want to try getting involved with black market train tickets, so I ended up on a bus, as China chose to remind me about scale a little more:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/bus.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 402px; height: 301px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/bus.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427629187558193650&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It''s a nice enough-looking bus, reminds me of the super-comfy Argentinian/Chilean buses... but that was a mirage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I had already traveled 36 hours pretty much directly due East by train from Lhasa, Shanghai, and the Easternmost border of China was another 18 hour bus ride away. And while the bus looked like one of the nice South American buses, inside the economies of Chinese scale dictated that we squeeze in as many passengers as possible, meaning not just seats designed for relatively short Chinese people, but seats to make even relatiely short Chinese people uncomfortable... I did get my few hours of sleep on the bus, in spite of the appalling lack of leg room, but I''m not feeling all that anxious to take any further bus rides in this country at the moment!&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=''1'' height=''1'' src=''https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2883997969551391628-913201413844831817?l=safety3rd.blogspot.com'' alt='''' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;', NULL, NULL, 'China knows Scale', 'http%3A%2F%2Fsafety3rd.blogspot.com%2F2010%2F02%2Fchina-knows-scale.html', 1, 'Alex', NULL, 'Xi''an', 2, NULL, NULL);

It''s a budget airline, but they [generally] do budget well: the planes are new, seats are comfortable enough, and, hey, they are cheap! So, while I wasn''t exactly expecting a reprise of Eva Air with three passengers on board, I figured I had reason to be optimistic. And the flight to Manila was optimistic enough, as I had a whole row of three seats all to myself. I probably even slept for an hour and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manila was where things started to get a little more interesting - I got off the plane and headed out to look for my next flight. Encouraged by lots of Transfer signs in the terminal, I skirted around the lines for immigration and ended up at the Transfer desk. Which was empty. Except for a security guard, who called for an agent. We waited for an agent... This was at about 4 in the morning, so my patience wasn''t on its best behavior after some 10 minutes. After another 10 minutes and a bit more prompting from me, an agent materialized. And slowly sauntered down the hall. Finally(!), she made her way down to us (another plane had landed in the mean time, and the transfer desk was now home to three of us), and announced that we had to go and get our bags. I was not amused - why!? My luggage tag clearly indicates Hong Kong as the bag''s destination. She babbled on about airport regulations. I felt she was full of shit and clueless, but followed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, between us and the baggage counter lay immigration. I, once again, pointedly noted that I wasn''t actually staying in the Philippines, so I didn''t need immigration. We went anyway, came around the line, and ended up with a Filipino entry stamp each. I thought about running out of space in my passport, we moved on anyway. Finally at baggage claim, a good 45 minutes after deplaning, I got my bag, and was told to take it over to another transfer desk, this one down on this level. Some more in-decipherable chatting followed, then my bag was taken away again, and my original luggage tag returned. We walked back towards the gates. I inquired as to the whole point of this process, since it seemed completely pointless - they didn''t need me to come down to baggage claim, through immigration, just to carry my bags 50 feet. My Cebu agent prattled on about regulations and how new this terminal was. I paid just enough attention to start to gather a picture (in the mean time we passed back through immigration... and didn''t stop this time. I knew I probably should have said something, but I didn''t really want a Filipino exit stamp for my 3 hour stay at the Manila airport).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the picture: the staff at the airport aren''t allowed to handle passengers'' bags. Security measure, I guess. But, how do you do transfers then? Well, some background - Cebu Pacific has an entire terminal in Manila. Apparently, this terminal was built some 7-8 years ago, then sat unused for about five years, while everybody fought and argued about what should be done with it. Somehow, the argument was never really resolved, and Cebu (which might not have even existed 7 years ago?) ended up with the terminal almost by the default. I suppose they are the 2nd biggest Filipino carrier, after Philippine Airlines. But whereas Philippine Airlines, being a somewhat established carrier, has automated transfer facilities in its terminal, Cebu is a budget carrier, specializing in point-to-point flights, so they do not. The rules still apply though, so if you do end up with an international transfer in Manila, at the Cebu terminal, you have to carry the luggage yourself, all the way to the transfer desk 50 feet away - the staff aren''t allowed to touch it, and the machinery hasn''t been installed. My sauntering agent-lady claimed it wasn''t installed yet, as this terminal is so new, however as the terminal has actually been around (if not used) for a while, I suspect Cebu just hasn''t bothered, since they don''t get a lot of international transfers. And immigration, of course, expects you to be stamped into their country before you can go to baggage claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this took an hour and a half in the middle of the night, and I learned a little more than i had wanted about the Filipino Civil Aviation regulations. But, of course, I wasn''t actually done with Cebu yet, I still had a flight to catch to Hong Kong. Mine wasn''t scheduled to leave till 8, but another departed at 5:45. Agent lady claimed I''d have to rebook (and pay the fare difference in fare) to get on the earlier flight, but now I knew she was full of shit, so I went for the gate and asked about stand-by''s. They explained the flight was already over-sold. I sulked a bit, and headed over to find some early breakfast - just as my salmon and cream cheese focaccia was arriving the gate agent came back looking for Mr Alex, and announced that they did have a seat available for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer waiting in Hong Kong to waiting in Manila so I went off. My bag, unfortunately, didn''t have quite as much free will to direct its own destiny, and, after 10 minutes on the walkie talkie, we decided it was still going to be on the 8 o''clock flight. I didn''t really care, so things got interesting. I landed in Hong Kong and confirmed that my bag wasn''t joining me, as expected. I didn''t really want to hang around for two hours waiting for it though, so I went off searching for another Cebu agent to see if they could help with this situation. An agent was, once again, difficult to locate (I was getting annoyed with them by now... maybe because I had slept for about 3 hours total, all on airplanes), but I eventually found one upstairs by the check-in counters. She considered my situation - I proposed leaving the bag with Cebu till that evening when I would actually need it for my flight to London - and stated that they weren''t really allowed to that. However, here''s the number for Lost and Found, just go into town now and make sure to call them in a couple hours to verify that they got your bag, and come back to get it a couple hours early. And you didn''t hear any of this from me! I considered the solution to be fairly ingenious, in spite of finding a few potential potholes in the execution, so I went with it and got on a bus for Hong Kong. A couple of hours later, a helpful gentleman at Lost and Found confirmed that they had, in fact, located my bag - I promised to come back for it around nine, and they assured me it would be waiting. Well, I actually showed up around 10 (I played frisbee in the afternoon, and felt I deserved an hour''s worth of massage before spending a second consecutive night on an airplane; and that was time and money well spent!), but the bag was, in fact, waiting for me, after some 20 minutes of talking, checking and waiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S40V59LKVkI/AAAAAAAAI44/eF3hexzUXF8/s1600-h/hk.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S40V59LKVkI/AAAAAAAAI44/eF3hexzUXF8/s400/hk.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5444031609978902082&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hong Kong wasn''t quite this gray and sinister on this day (I did enjoy a few hours of playing frisbee on the beach shortly before taking this picture on the ferry back), but it was rather overcast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, finished with Cebu, I now headed over for Qatar Airways, my 5-Star airline destined for London. I continue to suspect that the 5-star rating is self assigned... First, of course, I had to re-pack my bag once again, as Cebu charges for checked luggage over 15kg, so, obviously, I just carried 5 extra kilos of carry-on luggage with me (what, you thought I''d be willing to pay, sauntering agent lady?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Qatar flight came in two legs: about 8 hours to Doha, Qatar. Then another 8/9 hours from there to London. My Doha layover could''ve just been a couple of hours, but I opted for a later flight, spending some six hours in the state of Qatar. I figured I might see something... Well, what I saw wasn''t particularly interesting - the Persian Gulf countries are dominated by, well, sand. And flatness. On the horizon, I could see the gleaming towers of Doha. Nearby, I could see dusty two and three story buildings, that wouldn''t have looked any different in any other part of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S40V6SZjHVI/AAAAAAAAI5I/Pgz7bD5H8yo/s1600-h/doha.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S40V6SZjHVI/AAAAAAAAI5I/Pgz7bD5H8yo/s400/doha.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5444031615676390738&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And Doha has this weird water tower thing to greet you...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S40V6MqdAwI/AAAAAAAAI5A/FiX3QnGEaRk/s1600-h/qatar.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 225px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S40V6MqdAwI/AAAAAAAAI5A/FiX3QnGEaRk/s400/qatar.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5444031614136681218&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;All&lt;/b&gt; the planes I saw on the ground were Qatar Airways. The only other one I saw was from Air Atlanta Icelandic, which seemed horribly out of place here, in the desert. I later learned that it belonged to an Icelandic company that simply leases places around the world. This was likely one of the two they had out on lease to Saudi Arabia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I had plenty of time to take all of this in, as we landed, deplaned, boarded a shuttle bus, then must have traveled some 20 minutes to reach the chaotic terminal building (dominated by the sprawling duty free store). Considering that the whole country is flat, sandy, and empty (as far as I can tell), I''m not sure why the runway couldn''t have been closer to the terminal, but maybe they have a reason... The whole time, I kept expecting Dubai''s newly constructed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.glasssteelandstone.com/Images/UAE/BurjDubai-A04.jpg&quot;&gt;Burj Dubai&lt;/a&gt; to poke over the horizon - it''s the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.burjkhalifa.ae/&quot;&gt;tallest building in the world&lt;/a&gt;, and at over 850 meters in height (that''s almost a freaking kilometer!), it''s over 350 meters taller than the 504 meter Taipei 101, now #2 in the world. Alas, it''s apparently not quite tall enough to be visible from Qatar. Well, it is almost 400km away... Slightly ruining my pre-conceived notions of the place, was what I could not see around me - not a single mosque... There was one inside the airport, of course, but, I suppose, this isn''t Saudi Arabia, so we are probably not quite as fanatically Muslim around here...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my 5-star flights? Well, they were nice, albeit not quite overwhelming. I slept most of my first flight, and kept myself busy watching TV and drinking French Syrah on the next one. 5-star or not, but they do provide as much complimentary wine/beer/spirits as you can handle - I landed with a bit of a headache... The food was pretty good, and the entertainment system, of course, absolutely blew anything on an American-based carrier away. But it also lived in a computer box under the seat, which limited my leg room, which I didn''t appreciate. All in all, certainly one of the nicer flights I''ve been on, but Emirates was definitely better, and Thai Airways could probably give it a run for its money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And four flights and three cities after leaving Taiwan, I finally arrived in London, which was cold, but at least not rainy!&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=''1'' height=''1'' src=''https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2883997969551391628-2179256752132696488?l=safety3rd.blogspot.com'' alt='''' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;', NULL, NULL, 'As for the next flight...', 'http%3A%2F%2Fsafety3rd.blogspot.com%2F2010%2F03%2Fas-for-next-flight.html', 1, 'Alex', NULL, 'Doha,Hong Kong,Manila,Taipei,London', 2, NULL, NULL);
INSERT INTO `rr2008_msgs` VALUES (271, '2010-03-03 09:24:00', NULL, 'That''s, in part, literal, of course - fresh air is hard to come by in Chinese cities. Tibet was nice enough, but Shanghai? Xi''an? Ugh... Taipei, the Taiwanese capital, on the other hand, is actually pleasant. It''s still a big city, so it''s not actually clean, but there''s a lot of parks, a river, with a nice promenade, winds its way through the city, and the air is downright pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it goes beyond literal - I was certainly growing tired of China, and I actually found Taiwan really enjoyable. It starts with the people - I''m sure I''m missing all sorts of social nuances and generalizing horribly, but the Chinese people just don''t ever seem happy. It''s ironic, of course, given their recent respective histories and current world economic standings, but I found the Burmese and the Tibetans to be unfailingly happier than the average Chinese citizen. And just in case you might think it''s some sort of an ethnic characteristic, it isn''t - the Taiwanese are pretty much the same Han Chinese, ethnically, as the people on the mainland, but, when you meet them, they are far happier, friendlier, willing to help (or wait!). Definitive memory of the people in China: a lady slips and falls to the ground as she''s trying to get on a bus in Xi''an. Nobody even attempts to come and help. The woman directly behind her stares in obvious exasperation, then steps around and proceeds to get on the bus. The Taipei metro, on the other hand, has signs encouraging people to give up their seats to those less able, and people actually do it! Willingly and happily... And then, of course, there''s the two respective governments... I don''t think I have much new insight to add to the differences between them, just suffice to say that both sides are paying lip-service to theoretical unification (Taiwan isn''t actually recognized as an independent nation still by most countries, including the US), but after just 50 years apart, the two nations lead such starkly different lifestyles that, to me anyway, any thought of reunification seems far fetched, at best. Well, it''s not all that different than re-integrating Hong Kong and Macau into China, I suppose, so we can see how that goes over the next 50 years. I predict, not well. One thing to add about the differences in government and people is the capitalism - in China it is simply characterized by basic, unrestrained human greed - everyone''s goal, including the government''s, appears to be to extract every last penny from you that they can, rip you off if they can get away with it, institutionalize the ripoff if possible. Which is exactly the atmosphere that seems to contribute to the pervading anger, by the way... In my five days in Taiwan, I got to visit the Taroko Gorge, an incredibly popular (and beautiful) national park, and the Wulai hot-spring, just outside of Taipei, also quite popular. Total spent on admissions: 0. The same happening in China: inconceivable! That being said, Taiwan is certainly more expensive than China, but it feels a lot more worthwhile. (The unrestrained greed, by the way, is quite emblematic of most of these newly free market countries - China, Russia, Vietnam, so it may, admittedly, have a lot more to do with basic human nature than the Chinese government). There''s plenty of foreigners in both places, of course - usually there to either teach English or study Chinese, and they tend to fit into the patterns too. The foreigners in Taiwan remained happy, while the longer you stay in China, the more it seems to turn you angry! And speaking of English, it''s always an adventure out here - Chinese clearly doesn''t translate well, but while it''s just amusingly terrible in China (and the people seem too proud/stubborn to ask for help), it''s usually relatively decent in Taipei, especially at any official/government places. I wonder if it''s just a product of better education, perhaps due to more exposure to foreigners?, or simply a willingness to ask for help... The Taiwanese certainly seem to travel around the world a lot more, which has got to help...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so I liked being in Taiwan more than I liked being in China (even admitting that China does have some amazing sites to see), but enough with the ranting, time to move on to the actual time in Taiwan, including pictures, of course:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S41JjEDlTkI/AAAAAAAAI5Q/aimVtaLKhWE/s1600-h/101.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S41JjEDlTkI/AAAAAAAAI5Q/aimVtaLKhWE/s400/101.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5444088391293816386&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Taipei 101 is over 500 meters tall and absolutely towers over the rest of the city.

Paved, lighted walkways criss-cross the mountains&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, is a rather modern city, with the 5 year old Taipei 101 tower, a source of local pride, clearly serving as a sign of this modernity. While the skyline of places like Hong Kong, Singapore, and Shanghai is dotted with various skyscrapers, Taipei 101 pretty much has the city all to itself. The other thing you quickly notice is that the entire city is ringed with green mountains. Taiwan, is basically just a big volcano rising from the bottom of the Pacific - it, in fact, is home to the tallest peak in Eastern Asia (Eastern Asia is kinda hard to define, so let''s just say, not including the Himalayas).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people of Taiwan also happen to be the religious sort, so there''s a fair number of intricately decorated temples scattered around town. The Chinese themselves, by the way, seem to be re-discovering religion these days too, with some gentle encouragement from the government...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S41Jud9FGOI/AAAAAAAAI6I/aZH-l0genYI/s1600-h/longshan.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S41Jud9FGOI/AAAAAAAAI6I/aZH-l0genYI/s400/longshan.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5444088587224422626&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Taipei''s Longshan Temple - absolutely crowded on a weekend afternoon.

It''s certainly true! England suffers from a few problems (not including the current frigid temperatures) - first of all, none of the streets are ever straight; they wind, they twist, the loop and circle - they are beautiful, scenic, picturesque, and ... difficult to keep a bearing on! And then, there''s the street signs - places like chaotic Buenos Aires have very clear street signs (Shanghai''s are the best actually - they are not just in English, but they also give you compass points - N/S, E/W, so you know which way to go). Here in England? Well, they do have some street signs. They are never lit up or anything, and are never in a consistent spot. And they seem to really be just reserved for the tiny small streets - the big ones have been here for seven hundred years - &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt; knows where this one goes! Oh, tourists... Raaiiight...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, British streets annoy me a little. No matter, I took a few scenic detours around the towns, and managed to find my friends here in England, and take in a few sights. No thanks to the tourist information offices either - I''ve seen a few so far, but none that were open as of yet. Union-mandated smoking break, I can only assume... At least the people are happy to help, and speak something that passes for English.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a day of decompressing back in London, the first stop was Bristol, the home of the intrepid adventurists, as in the people who organize the Mongol Rally and the Rickshaw Run. I did manage to find their office (which wasn''t honestly interesting enough to merit any photography...), then headed off to see a bit of the rest of the old town. And to their credit, the English towns (with their winding streets and all) are very pretty - surrounded by rolling green plains of the countryside, and with Gothic steeples of churches and cathedrals poking up all over the place:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S5WJ5McaBcI/AAAAAAAAI64/AaYfwDrcEaI/s1600-h/uni.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S5WJ5McaBcI/AAAAAAAAI64/AaYfwDrcEaI/s400/uni.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5446410940060403138&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The massive center building of the University of Bristol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S5WJ6LhAErI/AAAAAAAAI7I/e20b-13_7XE/s1600-h/cathedral.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S5WJ6LhAErI/AAAAAAAAI7I/e20b-13_7XE/s400/cathedral.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5446410956991107762&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Bristol Cathedral in the evening&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S5WJ5fcl2uI/AAAAAAAAI7A/hsqP1j2FYIQ/s1600-h/bridge.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S5WJ5fcl2uI/AAAAAAAAI7A/hsqP1j2FYIQ/s400/bridge.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5446410945161452258&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Bristol seems fairly proud of its Suspension Bridge.

Easily my least favorite of any public transit systems around the world. Not only is there no semblance of trains running on a schedule of any sort, but the trains are constantly stuck in the tunnels, and seemingly half the system is closed for repairs every weekend. Fortunately, half the stations appear to be redundant, so you can still get places (slowly), it''s just a bit more crowded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The standard explanation is always, well, it''s the oldest and largest system in the world - it''s very difficult to maintain. Pity us! So, I decided to look up some numbers - wikipedia to the rescue:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the certainly the oldest system in the world:&lt;br /&gt;#1. London, 1863&lt;br /&gt;I couldn''t find a comprehensive list for this (you are dropping the ball here, wikipedia!), but a few relevant ones that I did come across:&lt;br /&gt;#2. Istanbul, 1871, even though that wasn''t really a metro line, and bears no resemblance to today''s lines&lt;br /&gt;#3. Budapest, 1896 (#''s 2 and 3 were a bit of a surprise for me as well)&lt;br /&gt;#4. Paris, 1900&lt;br /&gt;#5. New York, 1904&lt;br /&gt;Tokyo: 1927&lt;br /&gt;Moscow: 1935&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But is it the largest? No, not by any measure:&lt;br /&gt;By Length of Rail:&lt;br /&gt;#1. New York: 1056km&lt;br /&gt;#2. Berlin: 483km&lt;br /&gt;#3. London: 415km&lt;br /&gt;#4. Moscow: 340km&lt;br /&gt;#5. Tokyo: 281km&lt;br /&gt;#6. Paris: 211km&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By number of stops:&lt;br /&gt;#1. New York: 468&lt;br /&gt;#2. Paris: 368&lt;br /&gt;#3. Berlin: 354&lt;br /&gt;#4. London: 275&lt;br /&gt;#5. Tokyo: 274&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By number of passengers (annually):&lt;br /&gt;#1. Tokyo: 3.174 Billion&lt;br /&gt;#2. Moscow: 2.392 Billion (a decline of almost a billion from 1997?)&lt;br /&gt;#3. Seoul: 2.047 Billion&lt;br /&gt;#4. New York; 1.624 Billion&lt;br /&gt;#5. Mexico City: 1.467 Billion&lt;br /&gt;#6. Beijing: 1.457 Billion&lt;br /&gt;#7. Paris: 1.388 Billion&lt;br /&gt;#8. Hong Kong: 1.323 Billion&lt;br /&gt;#9. Shanghai: 1.3 Billion&lt;br /&gt;#10 (finally). London: 1.197&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(passenger figures from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_subway_systems_in_the_world&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_subway_systems_in_the_world&lt;/a&gt;, statistics from 2007-2009)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, London is the oldest, but is neither the largest, nor the most heavily used. Nor is it open 24 hours a day, like New York''s. And while it is the oldest, you can''t exactly call New York, Paris, Tokyo, or Moscow brand new either. It may very well be the most expensive, and it has to be the least efficient, with long wait times, constant interruptions, and frequent line closures. By my count, I''ve used subway/light rail systems in about 40 cities around the world. London''s probably better than Manila... well, during Manila''s rush hour anyway! But, it''s got some nice decorations in places:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S5WKopX94cI/AAAAAAAAI8I/zYXIErf1ks8/s1600-h/waterloo.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S5WKopX94cI/AAAAAAAAI8I/zYXIErf1ks8/s400/waterloo.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5446411755280261570&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A clock at the Waterloo Station.

At higher elevations it snowed a good bit. So, we were pretty lucky to get a nice dry day for the trip, with some occasional glimpses of sunshine even... On the way back we took a more circuitous (and picturesque) route through the mountains, which would have apparently been inaccessible due to snow just a week earlier. On a further bright side, we were far enough from December that there was plenty of daylight each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon getting back to Reykjavik, we decided that the most expedient way to see the country (all of the country) would be to rent a car and do a three day tour circumnavigating the island, so after finding a place that would rent us a car for half the price of what the agency that the hostel recommended, we were all set to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S6VVbfywn3I/AAAAAAAAI_k/FZGGrsgiI-k/s1600-h/car.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S6VVbfywn3I/AAAAAAAAI_k/FZGGrsgiI-k/s400/car.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5450856854881083250&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Chevy was no mini, mind you, but crossing Iceland is also agreeably easier than driving across Eurasia!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to departure, a side note about food: much like everything in Iceland, the food is really expensive - you can expect to pay about double what you''d pay back in the States (apparently it used to be triple before their economy had crashed...), however, the food is really, really good! The local cuisine specializes in lamb and seafood, including both very fresh fish, and crustaceans, like lobster, crab, etc. Unfortunately, seafood also includes whale meat... In the cities (Ok, there''s only two of those - Reykjavik, and Akureyri up North, which, with a population of less than 20,000 people, is a city by default only), there''s also a pretty good selection of international foods - Thai, Indian, Mexican, etc. There''s no Starbucks, however, and McDonald''s has apparently ceased operations a couple of years ago when the shipping costs became prohibitive. There are some American chains that are still persevering up here though, including Pizza Hut, KFC, Taco Bell, Subway, and the one I was really excited about - Quizno''s! So, after grabbing lunch at Quizno''s, we headed out towards Europe (Reykjavik is on the Western side of the island, so it''s on the North American plate). The first day, we were still seeing a few tourists, and an occasional tour bus, as we passed a landscape filled with mountains, glaciers, waterfalls, and one big lagoon filled with icebergs breaking off from a retreating glacier, and a seal happily swimming around them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S6VVnDy-cUI/AAAAAAAAJAE/4M4rEiM8-KY/s1600-h/glacier.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S6VVnDy-cUI/AAAAAAAAJAE/4M4rEiM8-KY/s400/glacier.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5450857053524226370&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Sn&Atilde;&brvbar;fellsj&Atilde;&para;kull glacier - blue ice hiding behind the rocks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S6VVn28WdmI/AAAAAAAAJAM/36NWzPFXTsU/s1600-h/fog.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S6VVn28WdmI/AAAAAAAAJAM/36NWzPFXTsU/s400/fog.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5450857067253757538&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Mountains peaking through the fog behind the glacier&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S6VVm-X0VmI/AAAAAAAAI_8/NOthezNS9R8/s1600-h/yellow.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S6VVm-X0VmI/AAAAAAAAI_8/NOthezNS9R8/s400/yellow.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5450857052068140642&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Bright yellow grass, contrasted with starkly black dunes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S6VVb8pPOCI/AAAAAAAAI_0/YCZ-qQrxFwI/s1600-h/lynn.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 267px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S6VVb8pPOCI/AAAAAAAAI_0/YCZ-qQrxFwI/s400/lynn.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5450856862625773602&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Lynn getting ready to document it all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We finished the day in the town of H&Atilde;&para;fn, which is a regional center, but has a population that is yet to reach 2,000. It''s tiny. Late Sunday night, we found exactly one restaurant that was open... but the food was very good, as usual - lobster is a specialty in this part of Iceland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following day, we had a fairly long drive along the fjords on Iceland''s eastern seaboard up to Akureyri. By now, this was definitely no man''s land - the road was still pretty good (not as good as before though), but we could easily go 30 minutes without passing another car. We also kept stopping to take in the awe-inspiring scenery all around us:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S6VVoL0zpRI/AAAAAAAAJAU/CtTFQmb8PGI/s1600-h/beach.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S6VVoL0zpRI/AAAAAAAAJAU/CtTFQmb8PGI/s400/beach.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5450857072859260178&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A large rock sits perched on the waterfront along the Eastern shores.

There was exactly one other group renting a room at the guesthouse where we were staying - to my immense surprise, they turned out to be Russian, so we chatted for a bit. They were apparently from Russia''s Northern port town of Murmansk, in Iceland on business to purchase a fishing vessel for their company... They also explained that if I wanted to see the Aurora Borealis, I really needed to come to Murmansk, in the dead of cold Russian winter. Well, or at least Alaska. We headed out of town right there in Akureyri, Iceland instead, found a relatively quiet spot a little ways north of town that seemed sufficiently well shielded from the city''s lights, and sat there for an hour staring at the night sky... Unfortunately, the night sky was all that we saw. It wasn''t a particularly clear night, and the Northern Lights are a natural, unpredictable occurrence and all that... still a little disappointed, guess I''ll have to go Murmansk after all! Well, maybe start with Alaska...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final day was highlighted by more brilliant fjords along the Northern coast, a 6+ km tunnel under a fjord on the outskirts of Reykjaik, and generally unwelcoming weather - rain in the planes and lots of snow in the passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; &gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot; /&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/v/1373979103297&quot; /&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/v/1373979103297&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lynn did duly encourage me to drive relatively slowly though&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By now, we were between the two major Icelandic cities of Akureyri and Reykjavik, which meant there were more people around and the facilities in the towns along the way weren''t all closed until the summer, so we stopped for lunch at a little town on one of the fjords, and I found my meal of lobster bisque soup and scallops with caviar well worth the money. Like I said, the food was quite good in this country - this was probably my favorite meal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final day in Reykjavik gave me just enough time to return the rental car and drop by the National Museum. Then, all of a sudden, it was time to get to the airport one last time and complete the final leg of the trip - Reykjavik to Seattle direct aboard Icelandair... Time to start planning the next adventure, I suppose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It''s true, I didn''t actually do the cross-continental drive yesterday - I''ve now been back in Seattle for a couple of days and that drive was now almost a week ago, but &quot;Five days ago, I drove from Europe to North America&quot; just didn''t have the same ring to it, and this post took a while to put together...&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=''1'' height=''1'' src=''https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2883997969551391628-8231482328820575324?l=safety3rd.blogspot.com'' alt='''' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;', NULL, NULL, 'Yesterday, I drove from Europe to North America *', 'http%3A%2F%2Fsafety3rd.blogspot.com%2F2010%2F03%2Fyesterday-i-drove-from-europe-to-north.html', 1, 'Alex', NULL, 'Hofn,Akureyri,Reykjavik', 2, NULL, NULL);

It''s been here for a few centuries and nature has been trying to re-absorb&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you go to far East Asia, most places tend to have a lot of Buddha statues. The predominantly Catholic Philippines remains an exception, but ''communist'' China is all about getting in on the Buddha bandwagon. And while, I suspect, Buddhism tends to generally discourage competition (especially when it comes to depicting Buddha himself), this hasn''t really stopped everyone from trying to build bigger and bigger statues. Some time when I was in Burma (which really likes to build things on a grand scale), I started thinking about some of the biggest statues I''ve come across. And now that I''m back, and have access to my entire photo library again, let''s share what I''ve come up with with the blogosphere. Note: the list is by no means scientific, and I don''t even know the actual measurements of most of these statues, it''s just the way I had remembered the Buddhas when I had first seen them...

The Taliban has also taken the liberty of destroying one of the biggest Buddha statues in the world in the mountains of Afghanistan - the Buddhas of Bamyan. The Leshan Giant Buddha, outside of Leshan City, China seems to be generally accepted as the biggest Buddha statue in the world at 71 meters in height - then again, it''s unclear what the criteria are, as on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/featured/biggest-buddhas-on-earth/17118&quot;&gt;this list&lt;/a&gt; it only comes in at number eleven.

In fact, we had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://safety3rd.blogspot.com/2009/12/whistler-and-record-snow-fall-of-09.html&quot;&gt;record snow fall over Thanksgiving&lt;/a&gt; right before I left, followed that up with hardly any snow while I was gone, and the skies greeted my arrival back with a couple of unseasonably powdery weekends in late March and early April. Hooray for fresh snow! Only wish there''d been more of it during the winter months for everyone that was here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else have I been up to over the past month? Well, I''ve tried being an adult again and rented an apartment, that seemed a nice change from sleeping on a couch, both for me and the owners of said couch. Spring promptly showed up, bringing with it my personal favorite rite of spring - March Madness. When buying my return ticket back in November, I didn''t really give a whole lot of thought to my precise return date, and yet my non-plan happened to work out surprisingly well: not only did March Madness (NCAA basketball tournament) commence on my second day back in the US, but March 17th, my actual return date, turned out to be St. Patrick''s Day. I wasn''t quite up for an all night affair with a bunch of Irish backpackers like the year before, but I was all for hanging out with friends at a party - thanks, Ann! Three weeks later, the basketball tournament concluded the way it always should - with Duke being crowned National Champions for the fourth time in school history, and everything was right with the world of college basketball once again!

After taking last summer off, wakeboarding is once again in the plans for this summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the other thing I dedicated my time has, of course, been scheming for another trip. I really felt very much ready to just stop at this point actually, and am far less excited to be on the road again right now, than I had been at the start of the last two journeys, but Yael was getting married in Israel, Bailey wanted to go, and I''ve not yet made it to either the Middle East or Africa, so a plan was eventually hatched together. Helped quite a bit by a frequent flyer miles sponsored ticket to Europe. And while, I can''t honestly purport a whole lot of excitement about the unique opportunity to spend more nights in hostels, I am nonetheless pretty excited to see Budapest, Jerusalem, Petra, the pyramids of Egypt, Carthage, Sicily, Pisa, and the Niagara Falls just to name a few of the places I''m aiming to see over the next three months. Plus, there''s a lot of friends now in all those places along the way, so maybe I won''t have to sleep in hostels quite so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And just to get things started, I took a quick trip down to San Diego to see family and friends just before taking off:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-sjc1/hs439.snc3/25249_412120879714_739654714_5307563_4952294_n.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-sjc1/hs439.snc3/25249_412120879714_739654714_5307563_4952294_n.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;With friends in San Diego''s Little Italy, getting a base for comparing Italian foods in Italy vs the ones in the States&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S9tYfn0cGUI/AAAAAAAAJD4/Kr5Js6TJgnY/s1600/artwalk.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S9tYfn0cGUI/AAAAAAAAJD4/Kr5Js6TJgnY/s400/artwalk.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5466059873032345922&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Art on display - San Diego''s Art Walk in Little Italy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S9tYf9NqbQI/AAAAAAAAJEA/H6YIDZx_PSI/s1600/itan.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S9tYf9NqbQI/AAAAAAAAJEA/H6YIDZx_PSI/s400/itan.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5466059878775287042&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And that evening, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.discoversd.net/discover/images/thumbnails/events_section/279x370/miss-itan-event-26Mar2010115056054000.jpg&quot;&gt;Miss iTAN bikini contest&lt;/a&gt; at the Siren Lounge in San Diego''s S&Atilde;&uml; Hotel, a very appropriately South Californian way to spend an evening. The brunette on the right clearly should have won, but was robbed by the judges... She was born in Hungary, so I''m currently on my way to Budapest to try and set things straight... Or I could just settle for meeting a few of her friends and beautiful country-women&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, from the fun and novel department, we get this tale about Iceland. No, it''s got nothing to do with the volcano and the ensuing flight delays - Lynn and I were disappointed to have left Iceland without a single volcano erupting over the course of our stay there (eruptions are a regular occurrence there - most don''t play havoc with airspaces over Europe), and the ash has dissipated enough by now to not be having any affect on my flight to Budapest. No, this is about the 8,000 Iceland Kronur I brought back from Iceland and promptly took to Bank of America to exchange and deposit, along with my remaining Thai Baht and British Pounds. After verifying the pictures of all three currencies in her ''big book of world currencies,'' Brittney, my helpful bank clerk, processed my Baht and Pounds and moved on to the Kronur. Now, Iceland''s economy has hit a bit of a rough patch lately - at one point the whole country was just about bought by Russia, and the currency has fallen enough for Iceland to make some budget travel destination lists - not because it''s actually inexpensive, just because it''s a whole lot cheaper than it used to be. So the currency has been a little volatile of late, but I knew my 8,000 Kroner were worth about $65 USD. Brittney, on the other hand, just as clearly did not know that, and she informed me that according to her computer, my Icelandic currency was worth $1951 USD... I wasn''t quite ready for such news, so I duly pointed out that her exchange rate was off by a factor of, oh, 250. She called her manager over, conferred, and insisted that I take my two thousand dollars. I felt I had by now done my due diligence and left with a simple ''Thank you!''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I quickly transferred the money to a different account and wondered what would happen - eventually they''d have to discover the ''Bank error in your favor,'' right? This isn''t Monopoly after all... A week passed. And then Brittney called and very apologetically explained that their system was wrong (really!?) and she wasn''t supposed to accept Icelandic currency at all, so she would need to take the money back out of my account. I pointed out that the money was no longer in the account. I got a few more apologies in response, but eventually, your bank account will be frozen (big deal, I''ve got others), and they''d send it to collections. I felt ruining my credit wasn''t worth $2,000, so I put the money back. A few days later, I had my Kronur back, did not have my two thousand dollars anymore and was feeling a bit annoyed because that final, seemingly straightforward, exchange involved a lot more phone calls, waits, and trips to the bank than I felt it should have. I mentioned my dissatisfaction to dear Brittney, and was assured that a manager would be calling me back to ''set everything right.''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two more weeks passed. I had time to wonder what the bank''s version of ''setting everything right'' might end up being; it didn''t seem like it would be sufficient. Yet, no apologetic word from the manager, or anyone else. Anger kept mounting, so I went to visit the the bank yet again to express my new feelings. Brittney was very, very, very sorry again, but unfortunately, the branch didn''t have a manager right now (did the manager actually get fired over the Kronur thing? I suppose, I hope not...), and it would all be settled on Monday when the new manager was arriving. That evening, I got a message from the ''temporary manager,'' apologizing some more, and assuring that they had put ''a gift'' in the mail to make up for the inconvenience. Hearing about the gift helped upgrade from angry to furious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, Monday came, the day of reckoning - I wasn''t expecting much, but the new manager was certainly going to hear all about how I felt on her first day on the job. She was actually there this time, apologized some more, invited me to her desk, and went off to collect some more documents and information. I contemplated my attack. But before I could launch my assault and demand, say, a hundred or so dollars for my troubles, she came back and matter of factly stated that they would put ''the money'' back in to my account because that''s the right thing to do. This took me by surprise...&lt;br /&gt; - you mean, the $2,000? the entire two thousand dollars!?&lt;br /&gt; - yes, that''s the right thing to do, and what we should have done in the first place&lt;br /&gt; - uhm, well, that is the right thing to do. I wasn''t really expecting that, but thank you! Uhm, would you mind also writing me a letter stating that Bank of America will make no further attempts to retrieve this money?&lt;br /&gt; - certainly&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, the next day, I delivered my 8,000 Icelandic Kronur back to Bank of America, and had $1951 deposited into my account in exchange. Along with a letter from the branch manager confirming that the money was mine to keep. And thank you for being a loyal customer! Now, I generally tend to have somewhat mixed feelings on Bank of America, but any bank that can make my trip to Iceland not only inexpensive, but downright profitable, is OK by me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bd/ISK_500_note.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 427px; height: 204px;&quot; src=&quot;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bd/ISK_500_note.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Today''s Exchange Rate:&lt;br /&gt;1.00 USD = 127.860 ISK&lt;br /&gt;8,000 ISK = 62.5684 USD&lt;br /&gt;1951 USD = 249,454.86 ISK(!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appreciate doing business with you! At the end of this current trip, I will actually be making a brief stopover in Iceland again (just for two hours to change planes this time), but I think I''m just too honest for my own good to try bringing any more Kronur back with me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;As for the current trip, me and my black eye (deflecting a hockey puck with your cheekbone [two days before departure] apparently leaves a mark... Don''t worry, mom - nothing broken, I''m just going to look extra dashing for a week) are on the way to London for a few hours currently, and then on to Budapest by Friday evening. If you want to follow along, the website is back in operation and back to tracking my progress across seven continents - and this time, I plan to finally make it to Africa, that fabled 7th continent! No matter how much I keep hearing that ''real'' Africa is the sub-Saharan stuff, Egypt and Tunisia will still, definitely, be enough to finish my continent count.

It had been dark and gloomy ever since the morning, which seemed to fit my mood; I tried to busy myself going off to find a place to exchange my left over Albanian Lek and Serbian Dinars. I got 7.40 Euro for my efforts - the night before I spent 35 Euro for my taxi back from the airport and a second night at my hostel here in Thessaloniki. Net loss. And why was I back at my hostel in Thessaloniki (instead of on a beach in Haifa)? Well, because the airport is closed - the whole country is on strike. I posted this on twitter two days ago, while somewhere in the middle of Serbia, upon learning that the Greek trains were on strike:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q: How would Greek financial crisis affect the trip?&lt;br /&gt;A: Trains on strike, getting from Macedonian border to Thessaloniki TBD at the moment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I was wrong. The trains weren''t a problem, it was the airport that got me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brings up an interesting question - what''s worse, spontaneous riots on the streets of Kathmandu over raised fuel prices in the impoverished country of Nepal, or well organized strikes and demonstrations in Greece? Sure, sure Nepal still loses - &lt;a href=&quot;http://safety3rd.blogspot.com/2008/01/stoned-in-kathmandu.html&quot;&gt;they were throwing bricks at us&lt;/a&gt;, but at least the Kathmandu airport (guarded by UN peacekeepers) remained open throughout. Here, nobody wanted to bother me, but the airport was participating in the strike, and, voila, I was stuck. And getting stuck upset me far more. (Or is that the Kathmandu was over two years ago, and I''ve just moved on? Hmmm...) After all Tommy went off into the riotous crowds back in Kathmandu to get some pictures and [to our astonishment] returned unharmed, describing the rioters as rather friendly...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supposed to be in Israel by now, having left Thessaloniki on a flight to Tel Aviv at 11:30PM last night. It was by the time that my last pre-strike bus of the evening got me to the airport that I began to realize that there may be a problem - the terminal seemed deserted; I found a display, and, of course, all the flights are canceled today... The tower workers were taking part in the nation-wide strike! Til midnight. My flight''s at 11:30, think they just pushed it back by 31 minutes? Nope, I''m now ticketed to go on the same flight 24 hours later (calling the airline for a strike update before leaving for the airport tonight).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what exactly might we be striking about, you may be wondering? Well, it''s probably been in the news back home - the Greek government has this tiny, little insignificant financial ... catastrophe. They''ve got some loan payments due, don''t have any money to pay them, and nobody will lend them more money because, well, you apparently can''t ask a sovereign state for their first-born as collateral. So the rest of the Euro-zone countries, along with the IMF, are providing a 110 &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;billion&lt;/span&gt; Euro loan package (at 5 percent). It''s not real popular back in Germany, France, etc. either, but it''s apparently even less popular here. Because, believe it or not, those other EU countries and the IMF have insisted on some guarantees that Greece will be able to cut its national deficit over the next few years and, you know, repay the &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;110 billion&lt;/span&gt; Euros via some ''austerity measures.'' And now we''re protesting... and striking... and my flight is canceled because the airport is closed, and unlike the train service, they wouldn''t just provide a bus to Tel Aviv instead. And I totally saw amphibious tourist buses in Budapest...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S-LHDAm1PXI/AAAAAAAAJGQ/yaq-tNyKHAE/s1600/demonstrate.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S-LHDAm1PXI/AAAAAAAAJGQ/yaq-tNyKHAE/s400/demonstrate.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5468151752097611122&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The demonstrators marching through the center of Thessaloniki&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S-LTMdCyJzI/AAAAAAAAJHI/mP53F88ffJo/s1600/ktm.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 268px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S-LTMdCyJzI/AAAAAAAAJHI/mP53F88ffJo/s400/ktm.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5468165108489398066&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Contrasting them to the rioters in Kathmandu - the Nepalese have really got the riot thing down better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S-LHDatTPvI/AAAAAAAAJGY/BlSnZSJ2nvw/s1600/jimi.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S-LHDatTPvI/AAAAAAAAJGY/BlSnZSJ2nvw/s400/jimi.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5468151759104065266&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I met up with Jimi here in Thessaloniki - Jimi, the Greek mini enthusiast, who spent half a day working on mine back during the rally after we run into him in the middle of Serres, and is far more responsible for the mini getting anywhere near Mongolia than any of the other [many] mechanics along the way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S-LHR8PeR6I/AAAAAAAAJG4/kvGjBGwjyF0/s1600/water.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 224px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S-LHR8PeR6I/AAAAAAAAJG4/kvGjBGwjyF0/s400/water.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5468152008623933346&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The waterfront in Thessaloniki - before I got pissed off about being stuck here, I went for a little sight-seeing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S-LHSPpnApI/AAAAAAAAJHA/l5HiEi9jdFk/s1600/tower.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S-LHSPpnApI/AAAAAAAAJHA/l5HiEi9jdFk/s400/tower.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5468152013833831058&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;it''s just called ''The White Tower''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S-LHDtm6NqI/AAAAAAAAJGg/Ya0hSOkc9MU/s1600/rotunde.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S-LHDtm6NqI/AAAAAAAAJGg/Ya0hSOkc9MU/s400/rotunde.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5468151764177532578&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And this is the Rotunda of St. George.

Bucharest&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe it or not, I liked geography back when I was growing up too. And since I was growing up in the Soviet Union, a lot of the geography I paid attention to dealt with the countries of Eastern Europe. And a lot of them had capitals that started with ''B'' (and then when I was six, a huge shopping center named ''Budapest'' opened right across the street from our house in Moscow, really captivating my attention and imagination). So, why not see all these ''B'' capitals!? I got to Berlin just before the Mongol Rally in 2008; a certain Moldova-sponsored detour, brought me to Bucharest in July. That detour continued on to Budapest, but all I saw was the ring road that took me right around the city, so this time I was back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I got inside the ring road:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S-GMuDEf-yI/AAAAAAAAJEY/oU4g8hWNxEI/s1600/danube.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S-GMuDEf-yI/AAAAAAAAJEY/oU4g8hWNxEI/s400/danube.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5467806145330543394&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I also didn''t have a car to worry about anymore&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I got to spend an entire weekend wondering around Buda and Pest and taking in the sites of the city, which has begun to once again attract hordes of tourists, since its re-liberation in 1990. Before we get the photo gallery, a few general thoughts on the place... Now, just because I''m grouping Berlin, Budapest, Belgrade, and Bucharest together doesn''t actually make them at all similar. Berlin is, of course, a beast entirely of its own, a German city of never-ending night life extraordinaire. Budapest, a former part of the Austro-Hungarian empire stands out, not so surprisingly, for being far and away the closest to Western Europe (its location is the most Western-most too). The architecture is more reminiscent of my brief visit to Vienna than anything else, the city (and the entire country) is predominantly Roman Catholic, unlike its more Russian/Greek Orthodox dominated sister cities to the East. That being said, Budapest also has that unmistakable look of a big city in a formerly Communist country - it''s mostly just a feel for me, but I tried to categorize the visual clues that gave me that distinct impression. In the words of Jeff Foxworthy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your city might be a former Eastern bloc capital if:&lt;br /&gt; - your public spaces are relatively unkempt. The pavement on the sidewalks and roads is torn and cracked, and there''s graffiti on the houses&lt;br /&gt; - your downtown buildings are all older. Even if reasonably well maintained, there''s hardly any new construction sprinkled in.&lt;br /&gt; - once you get out of the center of the city just a little, your city is noticeably green and verdant. Wild green, nothing like the manicured Central Park in New York or London''s Hyde Park&lt;br /&gt; - the insides of your buildings (say, my hostel) are characterized by big, wide, empty, and usually unlit stairwells, and no elevators. Bonus points for trash and smells of urine in abundance, but those were thankfully not present in my hostel&lt;br /&gt; - smell of urine in your alleys? Definitely a plus!&lt;br /&gt; - shady looking men looking to sell some sort of unspecified (but shady) goods and services outside the train station, an even bigger plus! These guys, by the way, seem to have been generally replaced by the Nigerians in a lot of the Western cities these days, including Tokyo, Paris, and, surprisingly enough, Thessaloniki, Greece, where I am at the moment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, while Budapest is certainly very closely tied to Western Europe - culturally perhaps more so than to Eastern Europe, 40 plus years of Soviet domination have left some indelible signs of being a communist-run city. Alright, enough cultural anthropology, on to my favorite sights on the place:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S-GNjU1xBbI/AAAAAAAAJFo/80BF3g-o3hI/s1600/parliament.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S-GNjU1xBbI/AAAAAAAAJFo/80BF3g-o3hI/s400/parliament.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5467807060633650610&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The House of Parliament sits on the banks of the Danube&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S-GNSv2ZnHI/AAAAAAAAJFI/RHwu2Xx__Gc/s1600/basilica.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 267px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S-GNSv2ZnHI/AAAAAAAAJFI/RHwu2Xx__Gc/s400/basilica.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5467806775826291826&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Did I mention the Roman Catholics?

The Germans had the foresight to make their prisoners take their shoes off prior to shooting them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a weekend here, I felt like I had Budapest well covered, along with prior visits to Berlin and Bucharest, so all that was left now was Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. Serbia has some other distinctions as well - Belgrade is directly on the way to Thessaloniki, where I was headed to visit friends and catch my flight to Tel Aviv, and Serbia is the only one of the seven former Yugoslav republics we didn''t make it too during the rally in 2008 (Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Kosovo, and Macedonia being the others. Granted the coastal road in Croatia passes through Bosnia for all of about 10 minutes, but that''s ten more minutes than I had ever spent in Serbia). So, in short order, I boarded my Belgrade-bound train in Budapest Monday morning... and 8 hours later I had arrived in Belgrade (the journey really wasn''t interesting, so I won''t dwell on it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Belgrade isn''t a whole lot like Budapest. Serbia isn''t in the EU; it doesn''t draw anywhere near the numbers of tourists (I heard almost exclusively Serbian on the street, which is a LOT more similar to Russian than Hungarian is, by the way), and in a clear sign that reminded me of Russia and Ukraine, most women, these days, choose to dress like they are in some way employed by the adult industry (no complaints!). I also got to spend all of one evening in Belgrade, so my sight-seeing opportunities were a bit more limited, but here''s the best sites of the place from the time I had:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S-GNjWoR2GI/AAAAAAAAJFw/XMCW3JAW19I/s1600/marco.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S-GNjWoR2GI/AAAAAAAAJFw/XMCW3JAW19I/s400/marco.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5467807061113952354&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The St. Marco Church - me thinks we are a lot more Greek Orthodox around here...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S-GNvmeyAwI/AAAAAAAAJGI/NZK-Jr2IsPA/s1600/fortress.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S-GNvmeyAwI/AAAAAAAAJGI/NZK-Jr2IsPA/s400/fortress.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5467807271527514882&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Belgrade Fortress as darkness gathers.

It wasn''t full at 9 at night, every night though, as around 8:30, the whole hostel was out for a pub crawl along the local pubs, bars, and clubs, &lt;b&gt;every&lt;/b&gt; night.

Limits your fun potential...

One of the things I''ve really found enjoyable about cities in Israel so far though, is that there is a lot of art on the streets - be it just sketches on a wall, or a big metal structure like this one, or something altogether more abstract (a giant abacus?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S--UoiZZh9I/AAAAAAAAJIA/nGPddfeGs-U/s1600/cityhall.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S--UoiZZh9I/AAAAAAAAJIA/nGPddfeGs-U/s400/cityhall.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5471755496427456466&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Haifa main municipal building is housed in a gleaming new skyscraper (which the locals seem to think resembles a missile... hmmm, aimed at nearby Lebanon?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The star attraction of Haifa are the Bah&Atilde;&iexcl;''&Atilde;&shy; Gardens though. The Bah&Atilde;&iexcl;''&Atilde;&shy; Faith is a religion, founded in the middle of the 19th century, which emphasizes ''spiritual unity of all humankind.'' While that does sound rather abstract and maybe even a little pompous, the faith does have a lot of aspects that I can wholly support - quoth wikipedia:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unity of God&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unity of Religion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unity of all humankind&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Equality between men and women (!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elimination of all forms of prejudice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;World Peace&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Harmony of Religion and Science (!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Independent investigation of truth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Universal compulsory education&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Universal auxiliary language (?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Obedience to government and non-involvement in partisan politics&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elimination of extremes of wealth and poverty&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;So, yeah, I came to Israel, the Holy Land for three of the world''s major religions - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and so far I''ve had a chance to learn about the Bah&Atilde;&iexcl;''&Atilde;&shy; Faith. Not to say it wasn''t interesting... The big attraction in Haifa are the Bah&Atilde;&iexcl;''&Atilde;&shy; Gardens, which house the tomb of the B&Atilde;&iexcl;b (the man viewed as the forerunner of the Bah&Atilde;&iexcl;''&Atilde;&shy; Faith), among other important structures.

Petra was amazing, and will require a full blown post of its own at some point (hopefully soon), but we''ll skip it for now, and stay focused on adventures in Israel, which quickly led to the actual reason I was here in the first place: Yael and Etai''s wedding:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S--dTrZskVI/AAAAAAAAJII/b3qAIaMToYs/s1600/wedding.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/S--dTrZskVI/AAAAAAAAJII/b3qAIaMToYs/s400/wedding.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5471765033672020306&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Yael and Etai holding their marriage contract, while the rabbi reads the ceremonial texts.

Apparently Israeli Kibbutzes have expanded beyond collective farming to things like hosting glittering wedding ceremonies. The official part of the ceremony was very quick, and beyond that the reception was absolutely free-flowing - we ate, we danced, we drank, ate some more, danced some more, wondered around the gardens, chatted with the newly-weds for a bit, then danced some more. Israel is generally a lot less into rigid rules and structure than we are in the States, and the wedding (on a Wednesday night) was an apt example of this free-flowing liberty. That being said, it was certainly a big party - the guest list was over 400, and the dancing went on till after 1 in the morning. Which, technically, is a rather early night out in Tel Aviv...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next couple of days were spent exploring Tel Aviv. It doesn''t have any of the history of neighboring Jerusalem (what having been founded just over a hundred years ago and all) - it is, however, a relaxed, yet vibrant city, filled with markets, cafes, night clubs, and people on the far extremes of religious observance. A lot of Israel shuts down on Shabat (Friday sundown to Saturday sundown) - Tel Aviv just slows down and relaxes a bit more.

Everybody - men and women - serves in the army. I knew that. And everybody takes public transport to get to and from their army bases (the soldiers often get weekends off). I knew that as well. And while I also knew that the soldiers on their way home do take their guns everywhere with them, it was still a slight shock to see all these 18 and 19 year olds riding the train with their M-16''s. Not loaded... The trains and buses do feel quite safe though - not sure I''d want to be a pick-pocket getting caught by a bunch of armed soldiers...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing that kept coming up in conversations is that Israel may very well be a totally different country in another 30 or 40 years. And the threats it faces don''t come from the surrounding Arab world (well, there''s plenty of those too, but we''re not talking about them now). There is drama here after all - internally, Israeli Jews conform to a wide array of religious practices. Currently, the majority is secular, and religion plays about the same role in their lives as it does for most secular people in the world. However, that''s not everyone in Israel - exactly the same as Islam has its extremist factions, and modern Christianity produces lots of devout fundamentalists, Judaism has its fair share of Orthodox Jews of various sects. The people that I had only pictured as cartoons on the the streets of Brooklyn at the turn of the 20th century are alive and well here in Israel. Generally, I''m all for a ''to each his own'' approach, but that tolerance runs into some brick walls when the Orthodox sects practice a lot of the similar social practices that I find downright appalling in the extremes of the Arab world - segregation and extreme inequality between men and women, lack of formal education beyond religious studies (and even the religious studies tend to focus on rote memorization rather than interpretation), and closed-minded, ignorant, and rather militant mistrust of the outside world, especially the non-Jewish world. And where all this becomes a problem for the state of Israel is, quite frankly, sex - much like the fundamental principles of the other major religions, Jewish Orthodoxy preaches that sex is to be used for pro-creation only, which makes birth control irrelevant. Nature, however, has other ideas, and human beings tend to be hormonally induced to be drawn towards sex, even the fundamentalist and orthodox human beings, and the result is that the Orthodox population is growing exponentially in Israel, which will make them a majority in the country within another generation (which will turn Israel into a Jewish version of Saudi Arabia?), and, at the current state of affairs, will bankrupt the state, as anyone pursuing an Orthodox religious education in Israel is eligible to be entirely supported by the state while they study (until age 40 generally), and are also exempt from military service. So, that''s all a little scary... The place is filled with lots of really smart and ingenuitive people, so I hope they figure out a way for everyone to get along, without becoming a fundamentalist religious state!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And on a brighter note, in a couple of hours, I''m heading off to the airport to pick up Irina (from such previous adventures as &lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/Slbecm1RopI/AAAAAAAAH0M/d_KM5C9VxVM/s1600-h/plaza.jpg&quot;&gt;Colombia&lt;/a&gt;) and we''ll be spending the next two weeks exploring Israel and Egypt together. So, hopefully, the next mentions of the Orthodox sects here in Israel will be confined to photographs of people the two of us will be encountering in Jerusalem!&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=''1'' height=''1'' src=''https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2883997969551391628-1430031854699795263?l=safety3rd.blogspot.com'' alt='''' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;', NULL, NULL, 'Welcome to the Holy Land - Sometimes there''s Drama!', 'http%3A%2F%2Fsafety3rd.blogspot.com%2F2010%2F05%2Fwelcome-to-holy-land-sometimes-theres.html', 1, 'Alex', NULL, 'Haifa,Tel Aviv', 3, NULL, NULL);

The Holy Land&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerusalem... I''ve seen lots of places over the past two years, but none of them approach Jerusalem. It''s hectic, yet downright transcendent; it''s ancient, yet at the forefront of modern-day''s politics; the people here look like they still live in the 17th century, yet each has a satellite dish on the roof. It''s a city of contrasts, yet harmony, which manages to highlight both the multitude of differences and the even more numerous similarities among the people living here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, some of the more amazing places about Terre Sancta:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The History&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, lots of places have all kinds of historical significance - be it Rome, China, Egypt, or India, but none of them can compete with degree of difficulty, and significance that this piece of land, lying at the meeting point of Africa, Asia, and Europe holds. Three of the world''s major religions consider it holy, and hardly an empire has existed over the past three millenia that didn''t impact Jerusalem - even the far flung Chinese were connected via a terminus on the Great Silk Road. So, a few of the historical highlights:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TAktNFmqVTI/AAAAAAAAJMA/hZUrgjaYAs8/s1600/sepulchre.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TAktNFmqVTI/AAAAAAAAJMA/hZUrgjaYAs8/s400/sepulchre.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5478960124538803506&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Church of the Holy Sepulchre&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is only &lt;b&gt;the&lt;/b&gt; holiest Christian site in the world. This is the spot, where, it is said, Jesus was nailed to the cross, died and rose from the dead. I''m by no means religious, nor am I really all that versed in the Bible, but certain basic bits of Christianity are inescapable in our world today, and standing on roughly the spot where Jesus Christ was nailed to the cross is pretty awesome, no matter what your thoughts on religion are. And if your thoughts are a little more devoted than mine, then you are one of the many who''ve been making the pilgrimage to this very spot over the past two thousand years, sullenly entering the church, and prostrating yourself on to kiss the holy ground. We witnessed the spectacle continue to this day, and I came away, well, subdued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TAktNe4IJII/AAAAAAAAJMI/1NCcnEs6WOw/s1600/dome.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TAktNe4IJII/AAAAAAAAJMI/1NCcnEs6WOw/s400/dome.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5478960131322946690&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Golden Cupola is the ''Dome of the Rock,'' underneath it lies the rock, considered sacred by both the Jewish and Muslim faiths&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two holiest cities in Islam are Mecca and Medina, where the Prophet Mohammed lived and preached. Jerusalem, however, is next line, as it was here that Mohammed had traveled to launch himself heavenward to take his place alongside Allah. He, in fact, launched himself off of the rock, now covered by the gleaming Golden Dome above, which, as it turns out, is actually even more holy in the eyes of Judaism. According to the Jewish faith, the rock was the foundation stone of the world - it was here that God had created the Earth used to form Adam, and it was here that Abraham nearly sacrificed his own son Isaac, as a test of faith. It was also the site where King Solomon had erected the first temple (and after that has been destroyed by the Babylonians, the Second Temple followed... only to be destroyed by the Romans)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TAkuhAGLN2I/AAAAAAAAJNQ/fzX7TtqGcwQ/s1600/wall.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 224px;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TAkuhAGLN2I/AAAAAAAAJNQ/fzX7TtqGcwQ/s400/wall.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5478961566169380706&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Western, or Wailing Wall on Shabbat evening&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yet, in modern times, the Temple Mount, which houses the Dome of the Rock, is not visited by religious Jews. Instead, the holiest Jewish site is the Western, or Wailing Wall, which is, of course, here in Jerusalem too. It is, in fact, merely a retaining wall for the Temple Mount, above. But following the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans in AD 70, the precise location of the temple was lost, and upon returning to Jerusalem, the Jews studiously avoided the Temple Mount, lest they unknowingly step on site of the Holy of Holies, the ancient inner sanctum of the temple, barred to all except high priests. Instead, they began praying at the exposed outer wall, which the divine presence had never left, according to rabbinical texts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after the 6 day war of 1967, when Israel had recaptured Jerusalem, Moshe Dayan, the Israeli commander, handed over the Temple Mount to the city''s Muslim leaders. I assume because it is a holy Muslim site, and a site that pious Jews wish to avoid anyway. These days, the access to the Wailing Wall is open to anyone 24 hours a day - it acts as an open-air synagogue. Access to the Temple Mount, on the other hand, is very restricted - men and women of any faiths can go, but only at very restricted hours and days of the week. Unfortunately, not knowing the specific restrictions, Irina and I missed out on the chance to go up to the Mount... I guess, we''ll need to come back to Jerusalem again - next year in Jerusalem?

A massive wall separates Jerusalem from the Palestinian West Bank. Just on the other side of this wall lies the town of Bethlehem. Here sits the Church of Nativity - the world''s oldest continuously operating church (commissioned in AD 326) is the birthplace of Jesus. The Grotto of the Nativity here has a continuous line of men and women ready to offer their prayers to the very spot were baby Jesus was said to have been born. We snuck in from the exit to catch a glimpse of the place, but I was wary of taking pictures...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TAksoHf2ySI/AAAAAAAAJL4/82Yetmf-T38/s1600/russian.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 257px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TAksoHf2ySI/AAAAAAAAJL4/82Yetmf-T38/s400/russian.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5478959489391970594&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Russian Chapel of the Ascension&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mostly, I included this photo simply because it''s a beautiful golden-dome Russian Church. The Russian Orthodox Church does, however, claim, that this is the precise spot where Jesus made his ascent to heaven... Jerusalem is sort of like a capital of Christianity, so various sects, or states have their own churches and hospices in the city. Funny how the Buddhist nations all do the exact same thing in Gaya, India, the spot where Buddha had initially achieved enlightenment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The People&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get past the history and arrive in the present day, the most fascinating thing about today''s Jerusalem is the widely diverse people that inhabit the place. The Old City is split up into four quarters - Jewish, Arabic, Christian, and Armenian. Yes, I know, the Armenians don''t seem to belong, but Armenia was apparently the first nation to adopt Christianity, and they had made a significant alliance with the Crusaders when they had come to reclaim the city in the Middle Ages... In summary, they''ve got a quarter, but it''s small and very quiet, so, unfortunately, I don''t even have any good pictures from there... But on to the fascinating, varied, emotional, and opinionated people of Jerusalem:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot;

Here''s what I don''t know:&lt;br /&gt; - there''s a ferry that runs to Sharm el-Sheikh. But I''ve been told by my hotel that it''s not running right now. It is, however, not possible to confirm this, as the ferry operator does not have a website I could locate, and the travel agencies around town have no idea.

I suppose I''ll have to give in and take a taxi to the bus station... there''s no public transport in Hurghada, obviously - everyone arrives on a package tour!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I''m frustrated... But the azure waters of the Red Sea are beautiful, and I do look forward to getting under those waters to go diving.

And taxi fares aren''t cheap when you have to drive for two hours, and there''s no competition, so the negotiations may have been a bit contentious. Most visitors to Petra choose to skip right over the negotiations process and arrive here onboard a gigantic tour bus. We met plenty of them going into Petra in the morning - by the afternoon, they were all gone, heading back to Eilat, Jerusalem, Sharm el-Sheikh, or wherever it is the bus had brought them from. Which meant that the Treasury, above, was just about all that they got to see in Petra.

I finish, and, as a sign of good faith, head directly upstairs, instead of stopping by reception - the laundry might actually be there now, right? Of course not, back to reception. Another frenetic phone call. Why doesn''t the laundry room (upstairs in the same building) have a land-line?&lt;br /&gt; - Ok, ready - they''ll bring it to your room.&lt;br /&gt; - Ok&lt;br /&gt;It''s not like I actually have big plans for the night here in Hurghada, so I don''t particularly need the laundry returned now, but I don''t necessarily want to keep dealing with this. 15 minutes passes while I examine that thought, and a broadly-smiling 17-year old materializes outside my door with the familiar laundry bag. The price is 10 pounds (which is very good value, admittedly), I hand him over a 50 note and he runs off to get change. I check the laundry - sigh...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smiling 17-year old returns with my change. I point out that the clothes aren''t actually dry. He takes the bag, smiles some more, and promises to come back. I go back to lying on my bed, studying the universe, wondering what he''s actually going to do...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifteen minutes later, I get another knock on the door - he''s now smiling even more broadly and making vast, sweeping ironing motions with his free hand.

So, I returned to the room in the evening. I flipped on the light switch. Nothing happened. Odd - I could have sworn I had lights in here the other night? I turned on the light in the bathroom, examined the room, didn''t see a light fixture. Very odd? I resumed introspection, and the waiting for the laundry. Five minutes later it hit me - that''s right, I actually removed the light bulb myself the night before, prior to going to bed! Why? Well, rewinding some 22 hours...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had just returned from the bus station, having decided that a 14 hour bus ride to Dahab would be stupid, so instead I was going to stay here in Hurghada and just dive this side of the Red Sea. The Thistlegorm wreck, the most famous dive site on the Red Sea, closer to the other side of the channel, would have to wait for another time. I brushed my teeth and turned the lights off, noting that they are using these high-tech, lower-power-consumption twisty light bulbs (pretty cool). So, I got in bed - something flashed. A few seconds later, something flashed again. What the? I studied the room for a moment - it flashed again. Weird... Pretty soon I divined that apparently, after you turn the power off, the high-tech, lower-power-consumption twisty light bulb continues to flash every few seconds here. I thought about static charges, capacitors, and college... then unscrewed the light bulb and went to sleep.&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=''1'' height=''1'' src=''https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2883997969551391628-7191517306937327074?l=safety3rd.blogspot.com'' alt='''' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;', NULL, NULL, 'On Egypt, Part II: Adventures in Customer Service', 'http%3A%2F%2Fsafety3rd.blogspot.com%2F2010%2F06%2Fon-egypt-part-ii-adventures-in-customer.html', 1, 'Alex', NULL, 'Hurghada', 3, NULL, NULL);

And an Israeli stronghold against the Romans two thousand years earlier - we''ll get to the history lesson in a moment. In the mean time, Masada is best accessed from the hostel that sits at the base of the mountain. Unfortunately that hostel was full. So was the hostel in Ein Gedi. We were instead sleeping at the Ein Gedi Kibbutz, quite grateful for the generosity of a couple guys we had found through couchsurfing. Having free accommodation at the kibbutz was very awesome, unfortunately it wasn''t doing us much good in terms of getting to Masada in time for sunrise - our hosts recommended getting up early and hitch hiking - the Israelis are quite practical like that. So, here we were at 4 in the morning, on the highway outside of Kibbutz Ein Gedi. We spent an hour here. Perhaps ten cars passed us - none of them stopped. We muttered bad things about the drivers. I don''t quite remember what else I was thinking or feeling during the time, but mostly I was unhappy about not being in bed. I vaguely remember Irina being not entirely pleased with me either, but the details escape me... Did I mention my distaste for waking up at 4 in the morning? I also don''t like the uncertainty of hitch hiking, especially when after an hour noone stops, and you end up giving up and going back to bed. Actually, that''s not true - going back to bed felt wonderful! I could see the first signs of dawn lighting up the Eastern sky on our walk back to the kibbutz...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The morning rolled around. We had gotten an additional five hours asleep since our middle of the night escapades and, feeling rather refreshed, were determined to conquer the stubborn mountain the next morning! Over the course of the day, the one and only taxi driver in Ein Gedi was located and his monopoly-inflated prices to take us to Masada the next morning were agreed to (Ein Gedi is not a big place). Then we met Katya and Sam and convinced them that they needed to see a Masada sunrise too, and thus the monopoly-inflated taxi costs came to be split four ways. And off we went the next morning - I can''t remember what time we got up, but while it was certainly still before sunrise, it felt a lot less horrible than the night before... or maybe we were just developing a tolerance for the pre-dawn insanity?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBHysVlxkhI/AAAAAAAAJRQ/dFKwpya80SI/s1600/sunrise.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBHysVlxkhI/AAAAAAAAJRQ/dFKwpya80SI/s400/sunrise.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5481429065010352658&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Catching the sun rise over the Dead Sea from the top of Masada, that''s what it''s all about!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBHys_B4z1I/AAAAAAAAJRY/8TN4UJFvDT4/s1600/all.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBHys_B4z1I/AAAAAAAAJRY/8TN4UJFvDT4/s400/all.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5481429076134121298&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Celebrating our triumph at the top&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the history lesson... Masada (meaning ''stronghold'' in Hebrew) is a sheer-sided plateau rising high above the Dead Sea. It was once a palatial retreat of Herod the Great, who, I presume, was a Roman governor appointed to rule the lands of Israel. Things aren''t meant to last though, so Herod died, the Jews revolted against the Romans, and a group, called the Zealots, established Masada as their base. We''d probably call a bunch of zealots holed up in a mountain-top stronghold terrorists today, but I digress... The Romans, in short order, came back and laid siege to the fortress. The zealots all committed suicide instead of being captured. This image lives rather vividly in the hearts of the Israeli Defense Forces today, who take their oaths at Masada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In modern terms, Masada is a big rock rising up above the Dead Sea, with 750 steps leading to the top. At the top, there''s extensive ruins and excavations of the historic site, and spectacular views of the Dead Sea, surrounding mountains, and the sun rising over all of them, if you climbed the 750 stairs early enough. Which we did, because we are a determined bunch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBHytPLt2JI/AAAAAAAAJRg/1zdN1xTGHSQ/s1600/romans.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBHytPLt2JI/AAAAAAAAJRg/1zdN1xTGHSQ/s400/romans.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5481429080470313106&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Roman ruins at Masada&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBHytgzbGQI/AAAAAAAAJRo/ZSLa5ficNyc/s1600/mtns.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBHytgzbGQI/AAAAAAAAJRo/ZSLa5ficNyc/s400/mtns.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5481429085200259330&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Surrounding sheer cliffs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of days passed. We left Israel and made our way over to Dahab, on Egypt''s Sinai peninsula. Not having seen any pre-dawn hours of the night for a whole three straight days, I felt the need to follow in Moses'' footsteps and watch the sun rise from the top of Mt. Sinai, which is conveniently located on the Sinai peninsula... Picking up a few new commandments may have been a nice bonus, but wasn''t a must-have. Irina had wizened up and upon learning that the way to the top of Mt. Sinai involved 3,750 steps - an even 3,000 more than Masada - chose to stay by the beach in Dahab. I joined the tourist horde and headed for Sinai.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sunrise was mildly disappointing, which would be a theme for Egypt - some amazing sites, yet the experience as a whole? Mildly underwhelming and disappointing. Now Masada is a big place at the top - we actually lost Sam for a while. But there''s not a lot of people there - it looked like maybe a dozen people were doing the sunrise climb, and a couple of Birth-right tour buses showed up from the other side (the weak and lazy among us can take the easy road on the far side of Masada, which goes just about to the top of the mountain. Not that we were making judgments about our collective superiority...). That''s Israel. Not so here - Sinai is in Egypt, and the Egyptians are very enterprising about putting together rushed, overcharged, and not-very-well organized tours for their attractions, so while there''s a lot less space at the top of Mt. Sinai, there is a hell of a lot more people up there - easily over a thousand in time for sunrise. On top of that, we left Dahab at 11 the night before, which got us to the base of the mountain a little before 2, and to the top some two hours later. Which, much as I had pointed out back in Dahab, is not when the sun rises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBHzFZWHPnI/AAAAAAAAJRw/MzHTtQFKSrQ/s1600/sinai+night.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBHzFZWHPnI/AAAAAAAAJRw/MzHTtQFKSrQ/s400/sinai+night.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5481429495515135602&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It was a clear night with a full moon, so no trouble following the windy path to the top. Avoiding the persistent camel peddlers along the way - much harder!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, we waited at the top. More people arrived. A lot more. Egyptians came by offering to rent rather disgusting-looking blankets because, you know, it gets a little chilly at the top of a 7,500+ foot mountain, at four in the morning, when you aren''t moving about for an hour and a half. I tried to sleep; it was a fruitless effort - the thousand people kept popping into existence all around me. We were one of the first groups to reach the top and picked out a nice vantage point to watch the sun come up. Over the hours to follow our vantage point was packed with a litany of new tourist groups, chattering away in German, French, Russian, and most other languages of the UN (except Hebrew, of course - relations are still a little tense with Israel). Finally, around 5:30 the sun showed up. Actually, there was some debate about this - most thought it was just the Moon. Judging by time and compass direction, I was fairly certain it was the Sun (especially as it kept rising), but, admittedly, the spectacle was awfully subdued - there was a lot of haze in the air, so there was none of the bright brilliant reddish-golden radiance, just a pale yellow orb slowly and quietly making its way up into the sky. Producing precious little light or heat at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBHzFutx4yI/AAAAAAAAJR4/4b-D7nP8KwI/s1600/haze.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBHzFutx4yI/AAAAAAAAJR4/4b-D7nP8KwI/s400/haze.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5481429501251543842&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Yup, that''s the rising sun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBHziOkRxdI/AAAAAAAAJSY/GslW5hsA2sA/s1600/sinai.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBHziOkRxdI/AAAAAAAAJSY/GslW5hsA2sA/s400/sinai.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5481429990837962194&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The mountains of the Sinai peninsula all around are a pretty amazing site though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBHzGH1teQI/AAAAAAAAJSA/8h_59b96Nqc/s1600/mesinai.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBHzGH1teQI/AAAAAAAAJSA/8h_59b96Nqc/s400/mesinai.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5481429507995695362&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I was excited to be up here, haze or no haze!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBHzGcHqF3I/AAAAAAAAJSI/Pi_JDLVl7zU/s1600/bell.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 267px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBHzGcHqF3I/AAAAAAAAJSI/Pi_JDLVl7zU/s400/bell.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5481429513439680370&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Mt.

First was the Dead Sea, which was simply spectacular - the concentration of salt and other minerals is amazingly high, so nothing lives in the water, it stings horribly if you ever get it into your eyes or mouth, but, you don''t sink! You lie down and just kind of gently float on top of the water - it''s the coolest feeling, I''ve never felt anything remotely like it!

I did not entirely see her point and went off to run some errands, which felt useful and productive, and, in the end, were largely a complete waste of my time - I suppose her theories must be correct!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final tally:&lt;br /&gt; - Masada: awesome, just hard to get to in the morning due to lack of transport options&lt;br /&gt; - Dead Sea: amazing, go see it before it disappears!&lt;br /&gt; - Eilat: nice, but if you''ve come all the way down here for the beaches, just go to Egypt, where the beaches are better and the prices are lower&lt;br /&gt; - Dahab: perfect!

I should have called the whole thing off... instead, I went to Marsa Alam, the Yin of Egypt came along, or the Yin of the people of Egypt is perhaps better. It''s a simple pattern really, that never fails to repeat: first they overcharge you, then they proceed to under-deliver...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, somewhere around hour five of the &quot;three hour trip to Marsa Alam&quot;, I was sitting by a window, watching the Red Sea slowly pass by, quietly raging, and passing the time composing the scathing review of the Hurghada tourist services I was going to write (but the passing scenery was nice). Then the Yang arrived: a bunch of kids boarded the bus in Al Quesir. One of them sat down next to me at first, did not speak any English, just called me ''Habibi!'' (common term of endearment, literally meaning something like ''my lovely''). A bit of re-shuffling came forth in a few minutes, and I was now sitting next to Said. Said spoke English, made fun of the other kid a little, and explained that they were all heading to the beaches around Marsa Alam to sell newspapers on the water-front. At exorbitantly inflated prices, of course. But since I had no interest in the papers, we just chatted for a bit. Said comes from Cairo, he had attended university there studying to become an accountant, but upon receiving his degree and spending six months looking for work in Cairo, gave up and came out to the coast and sell papers by day and work at a restaurant by evening. I''m sure I would have hated him were he to approach me on the beach and try to sell me yesterday''s paper for ten times its cost, but here on the bus, where he wasn''t trying to make a sale, he was a genuinely nice kid, and fun to talk to. He explained about the lack of jobs in Cairo, his nine years of studying English which, in reality, does not appear to help much in the job search, and how he liked the Russian girls because they were happy to talk to him, even though he was a mere paper boy - the British, on the other hand, were all stuck up and just thumbed their noses at him... Consequently, his collection of girlfriends presently included two in Russia, one in Switzerland, and an object of affection here in Egypt, who was apparently marrying another, richer, man... I wished him the best of luck with the Russians... The Yang of Egyptians: those exceedingly rare moments when you can have a conversation with an Egyptian man, who is actually not trying to sell you something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Yin survived and prospered, of course, as the great under-delivery of Marsa Alam continued right on course when I finally arrived - we were going shore diving, instead of the boat diving I had been promised (shore diving is an interesting experience to try, but is not what I had in mind when agreeing to get on a bus at 5 in the morning... which left at 7. Oh wait, 6:57 actually!) The shore diving, naturally, reduced my desires down to just two dives, instead of the three I thought I was going to be doing, but poor Imad was incredulous that I wanted to pay less for my two dives than I had originally agreed to pay for three. By now, I just laughed at him, fairly openly. His dive master had let the normal prices slip beforehand, so I was paying double anyway. The five hour bus journey back turned into an hour and a half by bus followed by two hours in the back of a cramped ancient Peugeot, whose driver seemed intent to kill us all. I did get a measure of revenge the next day when I yelled at Ali, my fixer, and got him to return a quarter of what I had paid for my disappointing experience. I''m not entirely sure where exactly to place Ali on the Yin/Yang scale as he actually seemed a reasonable fellow, and did come through with both my hotel and the diving in Hurghada. And I did watch him set up the Marsa Alam trip with another ''associate'', who didn''t looked so reasonable, or trustworthy, actually he had more of a look of a used car salesman. An exceedingly sleazy one at that. I later found him to be utterly incredulous that I had chosen to pay less for my two dives than what had been previously agreed upon as the price for three dives. He may have presented it in somewhat more convoluted terms... Regardless, whether my man Ali really was getting screwed himself or if he was just trying to re-assign blame to make me feel better, getting some of my money back was a major victory (and a minor financial one), especially as that''s normally an outright impossible proposition here in Egypt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBk15wPSb0I/AAAAAAAAJTw/aUVB_pFEaUw/s1600/listen.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBk15wPSb0I/AAAAAAAAJTw/aUVB_pFEaUw/s400/listen.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5483473287618129730&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;On the way back in the evening: Egypt''s listening... Somewhat ironic actually - the censorship turns out to be much stricter in Tunisia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I filed this whole experience away... Somewhere under ''if you found a place in Egypt that doesn''t offend you much, like Hurghada, just stick with it already!'' Following that line of reasoning, I promptly decided to skip Alexandria, since I was by now sure that it would be disappointing and frustrating and caught the bus straight to Cairo to get to the airport. Yin and Yang came along for the ride. First up to bat: Yin. The bus is ''scheduled'' (as much as schedules exist in this country) for 3 in the afternoon. I arrived at around 2:20 - I didn''t have much to do anyway. The bus showed up at about 2:45 and ... promptly left at 2:50. An Egyptian bus might leave two hours later than scheduled, or 10 minutes earlier - plan accordingly, and by that I mean, try not to have any plans riding on the bus arriving (or departing) anywhere at any prescribed time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, alas, the bus didn''t actually leave Hurghada, he left the bus station, circled through the city to the bus depot, dropped us off and took off, with some vague promises to come back ''shortly''. In the hour that passed, I had time to make friends with the Yang - I met Hany, an Egyptian now working at a hotel in Dubai, but formerly a tour leader in Egypt. An interesting guy to talk to - spoke perfectly good English and was also frustrated with the unreliability of the Egyptian buses. If anybody''s going to Dubai (and I certainly would like to some day...), I can hook you up with some help! Hany also, of course, has a Russian girlfriend - in fact, he''s on to his second one. But this one is all of 21 years old, so he didn''t particularly trust her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, Hany, the Yang of Egypt - the man was smart, knowledgeable, easy to talk to, and shared most of my frustrations about the place. He didn''t prove to be entirely without some local mis-judgments though, as we talked about car prices in Egypt. Apparently, a Toyota here costs slightly less than it does in the States. But 75,000 Pounds is much more difficult to come by for an Egyptian than the equivalent $13,500 is for an American, he countered. Quite true, I offered, but do you expect Toyota to sell cars at a loss in Egypt out of compassion for the impoverished people of the country? He was definitely still the Yang though - we chatted, he helped me try and figure out where to go upon arriving in Cairo. This was nice... then the bus finally came back: Yin happens... how much is a ticket to Cairo, I had inquired (more than once). Well, prices in Egypt are never posted - it''s a little harder to over-charge tourists if you actually post prices, you see - so I first happened to ask my sleazy car salesman. He told my 75 Pounds, I assumed he was lying, just on the off-chance that I would actually ask him to get me the ticket. I figured I''d rather walk to Cairo than ask for his help, but I digress. He was, of course, lying - I asked the ticket office, they said 55 Pounds. I asked Hany, he too said 55. I gave 70 pounds. I got five in change. I complained - Hany translated. The man matter of factly stated that the tourist price was 65 Pounds. I declared Bullshit, Hany apologized, the ticket seller walked away. I figured I had a better shot at getting one of his teeth than getting any money back. Yin happens, you are in the wrong country to be crying over 10 pounds (almost $2 - pick your battles!). The bus approached Cairo, the Yin percolated on board... finally deciding to demonstrate that it''s an equal opportunity affliction and can haunt the locals too (especially the ones who stray from the true path of robbing tourists... with a smile): you see, Hany''s parents lived not far from the airport. The airport wasn''t on the way, but there was a convenient spot along the way for him to get dropped off. And since it wasn''t all that far from the airport, I was going to get off there as well, and my taxi to the airport would be cheaper than one from downtown Cairo. Would have been, I should say, as this was an excellent plan, of course, and Hany shared it with the driver, in fluent Egyptian Arabic. The driver signaled his approval. We arrived in downtown Cairo... Remember the smiling kid in Hurghada with the apparent learning disability? The driver probably had the same condition... It''s called the Yin of Egypt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize: Egypt has an embarrassment of riches when it comes to world class attractions - from the ancient temples and Pyramids of Giza, Luxor, and Aswan, to the dynamic cities like Cairo, Alexandria, and (for some) Sharm el-Sheikh, to natural wonders like the Red Sea, the Nile, and the vast deserts. It is absolutely worth visiting. Egypt also has some really nice people. These people, unfortunately, can be hard to find. The vast majority of the people are greedy, lying, unscrupulous bastards, who have heard their politicians talk about the difficult economic conditions of the country (likely caused by the same greedy and unscrupulous people never paying any taxes) long enough to feel it is their absolute right (and responsibility) to extort money from the tourists who come anywhere near them. And if you don''t choose to come near them, they will come chase after you. If you ask my advice, I''d just say reward them for their behavior by staying away, but if you do decide to go anyway - the place does have all those amazing attractions after all - take a tour! It will, of course, over-charge and under-deliver too, but at least they''ll take care of all the negotiating for you, so you''ll get ripped just that one time when you buy the package ticket, and when your bus will be delayed for an hour for no good reason whatsoever (and yes, it will be), you''ll have someone to yell at!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBk0UhYSAJI/AAAAAAAAJS4/kD1aUKCdfLY/s1600/pyramid.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBk0UhYSAJI/AAAAAAAAJS4/kD1aUKCdfLY/s400/pyramid.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5483471548462530706&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Great Pyramid of Khufu - Giza, Egypt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBk0VZBtuLI/AAAAAAAAJTA/ZQ1btpUcPc0/s1600/jump.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBk0VZBtuLI/AAAAAAAAJTA/ZQ1btpUcPc0/s400/jump.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5483471563400263858&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I''m so excited, my pants are going to split at the seams in three... two... one... now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBk0UADT8wI/AAAAAAAAJSw/acjaDC4Tz1o/s1600/mosque.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBk0UADT8wI/AAAAAAAAJSw/acjaDC4Tz1o/s400/mosque.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5483471539516207874&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Mosque of Mohammmed Ali (no, not the American boxer!) - Cairo, Egypt&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBk0VoSUbII/AAAAAAAAJTI/L6u-wDOV_Mg/s1600/columns.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 267px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBk0VoSUbII/AAAAAAAAJTI/L6u-wDOV_Mg/s400/columns.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5483471567496440962&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The forest of columns at the Temples of Karnak - Luxor Egypt.

I could blame TunisAir, the Tunisian airline, but I think it''s Egypt''s fault! And, eventually, leave we did! And after a couple of hours, we had landed in Tunisia. And yes, of course, Egypt was still being very fresh in my mind, but Tunisia seemed like such an amazing breath of fresh air! Prices are posted, the people are helpful (without expecting a tip in return for their help), the buses are easy to navigate. There is no army of angry, foul-smelling cab drivers offering their services in place of the bus that is &quot;no longer running.&quot; People do come up on the street trying to sell something, but when you just say ''No, Thanks,'' they actually leave you alone... And every conversation doesn''t start with ''Where you come from?'' Better yet, the locals go to all the same places that the tourists go, which, keeps the prices in check (helps that they are posted too). I''ve also met some wonderful people here in Tunis, after finally deciding to give CouchSurfing a chance - they spent a large chunk of their Sunday showing me around the city. CouchSurfing, for the un-initiated, is a website that connects people with couches with other people that want to spend a night or two sleeping on said couches - it''s like a community thing. Everybody gets reviews, both the hosts and the surfers, so you, generally, try to not stay with people who get described as rapists and murderers. I''d never used the service myself before, but I''ve met many a traveler that swears by it - a free place to stay, and you meet interesting local people who are more than happy to show you around their town, time permitting, or at least tell you what to do. Then Irina and I got a place for the night at the Kibbutz on the Dead Sea using CouchSurfing (which worked out incredibly well), so I was ready to give it a try myself, and so far, I''m extremely pleased with the outcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this place does quite well as the Yang to Egypt''s Yin of Africa in its own right. It''s cleaner, it''s greener, it''s quieter, it''s calmer. The traffic isn''t as horrendous as Cairo''s; the attractions are better preserved; the people have some understanding of the concept of a queue. The attractions (the ruins of ancient Carthage and the beautifully preserved old city of Sidi Bou Said) might not be quite on the world-class, 7 wonders of the world, par of Egypt, but I''ve enjoyed the experience of seeing them so much more, that I do very much want to some day return to Tunisia to see the rest of the place. Egypt, on the other hand, the Yin of Africa, remains as a definite ''maybe... if I run out of other places to see.'' And if you''d like a haute-couture all-inclusive beach resort vacation? Well, Tunisia has plenty of those on the Mediterranean coast as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBk16y4cSUI/AAAAAAAAJT4/HQmU2LMEqJE/s1600/theater.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TBk16y4cSUI/AAAAAAAAJT4/HQmU2LMEqJE/s400/theater.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5483473305507481922&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Mohamed, Nes, Ossuama, and myself at the amphitheater at the ruins of ancient Carthage.

I''m certainly not like most other tourists (in my defense, I was slowly winning Irina over to my side), but while millions of tourists descend upon Sharm every year and seem to absolutely love it, I could best describe it as an abomination. An absolute abomination filled with too many people, so many in fact that the locals have long ago become terribly, horribly jaded, making them even more incredibly unpleasant to deal with, than your average Egyptian purveyor of crappy merchandise. And the place looks like an over-grown shopping mall, straight out of the American suburbs, with a bit more neon and loud music thrown in. Subtle, it is not. Over-priced, it is... And yet people seem to love it - I don''t really understand people. Anyway, the only worthwhile thing we did here was a camel ride, but I''m punishing Sharm el-Sheikh anyway by not including any pictures, so moving on:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cairo! Cairo is everything that is right and everything that is wrong with Egypt. Cairo is the home of the Pyramids, the magnificent and mind-bending structures that are over 5,000 years old!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;trivia time:&lt;br /&gt;Q: the Great Pyramid of Khufu was 146 meters tall when construction was completed in 2570 BC. When was the first building constructed that was taller than this Pyramid?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A. 1889, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, which reached 324m in height. Being in Egypt, you note that our civilization might really not have advanced all that much in the past 5,000 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ancient (well, not &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; ancient, compared to the Pyramids) mosques are also here, and Christian churches dating back to the times of Jesus. It''s the market hub of Egypt, where you can buy anything, and somebody will always be trying to sell you something, usually something you don''t actually want. And then there''s the streets of Cairo... I''m glad they have a subway system! The traffic is nothing short of amazing - the way these people drive is hard to even describe, but suffice to say that you are taking your life into your own hands every time you try to cross the road. But, we are not focusing on all that right now, today, we are highlighting ''amazing Egypt,'' so:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TCThIMYuhII/AAAAAAAAJWQ/x55IVFrSmbU/s1600/pyramids.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TCThIMYuhII/AAAAAAAAJWQ/x55IVFrSmbU/s400/pyramids.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5486757776924247170&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Great Pyramids of Giza!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TCThyV7MwhI/AAAAAAAAJWg/Har2FCQqhRM/s1600/sphinx.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TCThyV7MwhI/AAAAAAAAJWg/Har2FCQqhRM/s400/sphinx.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5486758501039260178&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Sphinx stoically guards the Pyramids&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TCThIS0nSpI/AAAAAAAAJWY/gElKxdsX3Fk/s1600/inside.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TCThIS0nSpI/AAAAAAAAJWY/gElKxdsX3Fk/s400/inside.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5486757778651826834&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;You are not supposed to take pictures inside the Pyramids...

If you''ve been reading my last few blog posts, that may have been somewhat of a mistake in the grand scheme of things, but let''s not forget the amazing, there were certainly more things to see in this country. So, I boarded a ''tourist train'' down to Luxor and arrived the following morning, quite comfortably, which was a little surprising. The ''tourist train'' is actually pretty good value compared to the rest of the world, but is, of course, ridiculously more expensive than the normal Egyptian trains. This would be perfectly fine with me, if I, as a tourist, wasn''t restricted from taking the regular trains... But I digress, Luxor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luxor is up the Nile and South of Cairo. Here, you are getting into what was once the Upper Nile, which was, of course, a separate kingdom and spent a lot of time fighting the Lower Nile. And then, they moved their burial sites to the Lower Nile and built the Pyramids... Twist of fate. But most importantly, at this point, Luxor is South of Cairo! And Cairo is in Africa, and it was June, and I thought my brain was going to melt. After I left my things at the hotel and headed out towards the tombs and temples, I passed by a thermometer in the center of the city - it read a remarkable 42 degrees! Celsius! And I actually thought this was Ok. That''s 107.6 degrees Fahrenheit, by the way, and this was at 10 in the morning. Now, I could have taken an air conditioned car to see Luxor. This is true, and it would have been almost comfortable. However, it would have involved talking to and negotiating with an Egyptian ''fixer'' on the street, who would then proceed to drive like a maniac and somehow disappoint me in the end. I wasn''t in the mood, so I rented a bicycle. And proceeded to pedal against the 42 degree heat... and rising. I drank lots of water - I thought it wasn''t bad, really. Still do - my brains may have melted... Since it wasn''t all that bad, I parked my bike in front of the Temple of Hatshesput and proceeded to hike over a nearby ridge to the Valley of the Kings. I drank lots more water. And I stopped in every bit of shade that I could find. It continued to be miserably hot - actually it got better on the far side of the ridge where there was some wind. When I came down into the Valley of the Kings, the locals seemed pretty impressed that I had walked over the ridge, so I''m still able to impress the populace - that''s worth something, right? After wandering around the Valley of the Kings for a little while, refusing to pay for the entire admission ticket (in part because it would have involved walking all the way over to the ticket booth at the main entrance - apparently they don''t expect a lot of tourists to hike the goat paths over the ridge), I proceeded to bribe a guard to let me into one of the more far flung tombs (it was pretty impressive) and promptly went back over the ridge to pick up my bike. An hour and a half later, I was back at the Nile and returning the bike back to the rental shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This could have been a good time to stop, go back to my hotel (AC''d!) and take a nap. However, I was determined to just spend one day in Luxor, still harboring thoughts and hopes of getting a few more days for diving on the coast), so I headed up to the Temple of Karnak instead. This temple is absolutely amazing - it''s gigantic, constructed, and added to over the course of several centuries by a succession of pharaohs and featuring columns grander and thicker than any I had seen in Rome and Athens (more of the how far have we &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; come in the past 5,000 years?). It was also stiflingly hot at 3 in the afternoon, and most of the temple is in an open area. Very open, very sun-lit, so I sort of dragged myself through the motions of documenting what was there and proceeded to head home. The good news was that I was tired enough that ignoring the touts along the way selling whatever was perfectly easy by now - just a non-chalant No, and moving on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final stop on the way home was the Luxor Temple... it did seem interesting, especially since somebody had apparently decided to place a mosque right in the middle of it. I looked at it and rolled over those thoughts in my head. Then I took some pictures of the temple (and the mosque) from the outside and went back to my room for a richly deserved nap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TCThyomvUPI/AAAAAAAAJWo/WVbXuv-3jhk/s1600/colossi.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TCThyomvUPI/AAAAAAAAJWo/WVbXuv-3jhk/s400/colossi.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5486758506053718258&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Colossi of Memnon greet you at the entrance to Luxor''s West Bank&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TCThy8BmwqI/AAAAAAAAJWw/OxKq-2srskU/s1600/hike.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TCThy8BmwqI/AAAAAAAAJWw/OxKq-2srskU/s400/hike.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5486758511266677410&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Deir al-Bahri, home of the Temple of Hatshesput.

It''s even further South and, thus even hotter. I suppose my brain was fully melted by now, so I didn''t care very much. Fortunately, there''s not all that much to see in Aswan proper - there''s a big mosque, an even bigger Christian Church, and an even bigger yet mosque under construction... Woo-hoo! The attraction here is Abu Simbel, which is another 3 hour bus ride South, almost all the way to the border with Sudan. The thoroughly amazing thing about the Abu Simbel temples is that they were going to be lost forever when Egypt built the Great Dam on the Nile, causing the water levels up the river to rise, and threatening to flood the Temple. To prevent this, international organizations (with a little bit of Egyptian input and assistance) raised a bunch of money and proceeded to cut the entire temple into portable pieces and move the entire thing, piece by freaking piece, to a new location, 65 meters higher, and safely away from the rising waters... Say what you will about the Egyptians, but that''s pretty astounding. When you actually get there, very early in the morning - the bus departs Aswan at 3AM(!) and see the temples in person, it becomes even more astounding!

I kept going, the path quicly turned twisty, windy, narrow, and steeply climbing. I felt this was just fine - I was, in fact, pretty excited about the whole thing. I was just upset that I wouldn''t have time to reach the ridge above me and get a glimpse of Mont Blanc... but you can''t have everything. Regardless, the path I was happy with. Turns out, not everyone shared in my excitment - the first sign of trouble was when I ran into a Spanish couple hurrying down the mountain and asking me [in Spanish] how far it was to anything down below. My brain initially refused to accept the situation and had to do a double-take - they are not talking to me in French, but I understand, must be English, right? No, don''t understand &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; well - oh, right, Spanish... There''s a little restaurant a little ways down below - you can probably get there in twenty minutes, treinta tops! What''s going on? Turned out, a little ways up above there was a woman who had broken her leg. I considered the path we were climbing and decided this didn''t seem entirely unexpected, unfortunate nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By this point, I couldn''t climb much further up the mountain anyway if I were to make the last bus back to Martingy, so I settled for simply going up to investigate. I discovered two women, both probably in their 40''s or maybe early 50''s - one in seemingly good spirits, but with a broken ankle, which was starting to swell; the other seeming a bit frazzled. We chatted a bit - I started with Spanish, they turned out to not be Spanish. Didn''t speak any English either, so we were stuck with French - the chatting was rather limited. The frazzled one was on the phone with someone trying to explain where we were - I produced a map and pointed roughly to our location. It didn''t seem to help the other end of the line all that much - I wished I knew more French. By now, I figured friends or family, not rescue personnel, had to be on the other end of the line - we started talking about trying to make it down the mountain. I offered that I''d be perfectly happy to take her pack down - I actually think that''s all she had really wanted, but through some combination of misunderstandings and my trying to help, we decided to see if she could make it down to the hut-restaurant below herself as well. We tried to come up with some sort of a workable way of getting down without putting any weight on the broken foot, which was a challenge, since the path was tiny, twisty, and steep. Eventually we settled on slow progress with me holding the woman around the waist, while she hopped along on one foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By now, I was starting to give up on the bus, figuring I could always hitch-hike my way down to the train station at the bottom of the mountain, so I could play Good Samaritan for a while - maybe learn how to say ''broken ankle'' in French. So, we hopped for a while. Not entirely surprisingly, it turned out to be fairly tiring for both of us - we took a break. The frazzled one was worried too. We chatted - they asked about my bus. I, in turn, asked if they had a car taking them down the mountain? No, they were staying somewhere in the mountains and had some sort of a car arrangement (that I wasn''t entirely clear on), that would pick them up, if and when they made it down the mountain. Or maybe, they''d send a helicopter... Either way, I should probably go and catch my bus... and see what the Spanish had managed to accomplish down at the hut?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine... after a few more assurances of calm and safety, I grabbed her pack, and took off down the mountain. Well, the first thing I actually did was trip myself and watched a rock accelerate at an alarmingly high speed towards my face, but I''ve still got hands for occasions such as these, so I came away largely unscathed. And proceeded down the mountain, a little more carefully this time. The Spanish were, in fact, waiting down at the bottom of the hill. I tried switching from French to Spanish to explain to them what I had learned, but my brain refused to process language switches quite that quickly - fortunately, they now had somebody that spoke English with them. My brain acquiesced to processing English. A few minutes later, Spanish became acceptable too, so I learned that the Spanish were from Tenerife, and lo and behold, they had been up in the Swiss Alps just last year too, when she had also broken her leg - and had to be airlifted out by helicopter... interesting... Anyway, I headed on down towards my bus, while the English speaker, whom I gathered to be some sort of a guide, hastened up the hill to try and help the two women get down. The people at the restaurant had apparently just shrugged their shoulders at the report of the injury, so a rescue team was probably not imminent. The Swiss seem pretty calm and stoic...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I headed down the mountain, reflecting that all I was missing at that point was somebody speaking to me in Russian about what had happened. I''ve no idea what happened in the end, but from where I had left them, getting down to the little restaurant shouldn''t have been all that difficult with the help of the guide. And from the restaurant, they could probably get a stretcher, so she''d be fine, presumably - just a memorable day in the mountains! Probably not even a helicopter ride to add to the excitement... Supposedly, a doctor was coming to see them wherever it was that they were staying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Alps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TDNUB3mQbfI/AAAAAAAAJao/GfZaXZfB9O8/s1600/mtnsice.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 224px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TDNUB3mQbfI/AAAAAAAAJao/GfZaXZfB9O8/s400/mtnsice.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5490824761775779314&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Trient Glacier stretches for 4.3km in the Mont Blanc Massif, flanked by a pair of snow-capped peaks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TDNUid-V2vI/AAAAAAAAJa4/AyOSQUSKb0A/s1600/mtns.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TDNUid-V2vI/AAAAAAAAJa4/AyOSQUSKb0A/s400/mtns.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5490825321833159410&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I''ve been to the Southern Alps in New Zealand, and the Japanese Alps in, well, Japan - finally time to see the originals!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TDNUhUtHMpI/AAAAAAAAJaw/G0nZxvZemLE/s1600/stream.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TDNUhUtHMpI/AAAAAAAAJaw/G0nZxvZemLE/s400/stream.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5490825302165107346&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Stream of snow-melt heading down from the glacier&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TDNUkPL0MSI/AAAAAAAAJbA/PesSpbLTJVE/s1600/cows.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 224px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TDNUkPL0MSI/AAAAAAAAJbA/PesSpbLTJVE/s400/cows.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5490825352222880034&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Just wouldn''t be Switzerland without cows grazing in the mountains, cow-bells ringing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TDNUAog1IJI/AAAAAAAAJaY/TVJMG6NcGts/s1600/minotaur.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TDNUAog1IJI/AAAAAAAAJaY/TVJMG6NcGts/s400/minotaur.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5490824740546617490&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Switzerland, I''ve discovered, is also rather fond of some utterly random sculpture, like this Minatour in the middle of Martingy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=''1'' height=''1'' src=''https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2883997969551391628-5783247494361899106?l=safety3rd.blogspot.com'' alt='''' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;', NULL, NULL, 'Multi-lingual Rescue Operations', 'http%3A%2F%2Fsafety3rd.blogspot.com%2F2010%2F07%2Fmulti-lingual-rescue-operations.html', 1, 'Alex', NULL, 'Geneva,Martigny', 3, NULL, NULL);

I hung around to watch and was rewarded with the amusing image above - the show''s celebrity guest, whom the audience around me identified as a former rugby player, doing a taste test for the Street Market Chefs - of course, the meal of the day was a portobellini salad, and while, I admit, it''s possible that the man may have discovered the joys of salads in his post-playing days, he sure doesn''t look like he''d ever come anywhere near a salad while he was a player!

That''s all changed now though - I''m going to remember this diesel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had decided I was going to drive through the French countryside, the Alps, and the Col de Turini (the ''&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theworldsbestdrivingroads.com/col-de-turini.php&quot;&gt;best world''s best driving road&lt;/a&gt;,'' according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.topgear.com/uk/&quot;&gt;Top Gear&lt;/a&gt;) on the way up to Geneva. I would have liked a convertible for the trip, in fact I would have very dearly liked the convertible BMW that I used to own, but compromises have to be made, so I ended up with a Renault Megane, a fine sporty little French car, powered by a diesel engine.

Pretty soon, I was discovering just what we are missing in the States, where we don''t have any of these sporty little diesels. It was a six-speed transmission, but in any gear, if you want to accelerate to pass, you just step on the gas, and the car takes off! I was mesmerized... I also had trouble keeping up with the speed limits... On occasion, I did glance at my gas gauge, soon discovering that it was refusing to change. A hundred kilometers passed by, it stubbornly showed the gas tank full. Damn, these things really do get good mileage... Another hundred kilometers passed by - still a full tank of gas! It must be broken!? Fifty K more - hot damn, we are down to 7/8ths! So it works then... this engine just doesn''t use any fuel. That''s a nice sidebar, of course, but I was here for the roads! I quickly ducked off the Autoroute after the Viaduc and headed deeper into the countryside along a route my map called Gorges du Tarn. True to its name, the road winds through mountains and a river bed following the gorge - the views it offers are spectacular, with little French towns dotting the side of the road, centuries-old church steeples punctuating the skyline at regular intervals. I started to think of what it could be reminding me of, and quickly came up with Albania: the very best roads across the empty deserted (but very similarly green) mountains in that long-lost European country were a lot like the roads here... well maybe the worst stretches of road here, in the South of France.

Picturesque, but very tame indeed. The roads are fairly straight, and the elevation more or less constant.

Here the road become tinier, windier, and devoid of traffic. Adrenaline pulsed through my veins. I pushed the car up into the rarefied heights of the Alps. I pushed it fairly aggressively in fact; pretty soon, my arms and legs were getting soar from all the shifting - I loved every last second of it! Shortly after leaving Sospel (around hairpin #7 - yes, I kept count), the road arrived at a little church sitting atop a hill. I was a bit reluctant to leave the road, but quite exhilarated to jog up the stairs to get a look at Notre Dame de la Menour and catch a glimpse of the twists and turns I''d conquered leading up to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TDNZ7FuwcmI/AAAAAAAAJcQ/AovjzKBNdV4/s1600/road.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TDNZ7FuwcmI/AAAAAAAAJcQ/AovjzKBNdV4/s400/road.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5490831242380210786&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;That''s my road!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TDNZ68acCZI/AAAAAAAAJcI/-NZ-l-ZeGmc/s1600/hairpin.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TDNZ68acCZI/AAAAAAAAJcI/-NZ-l-ZeGmc/s400/hairpin.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5490831239879068050&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is called a ''hairpin'' turn, mom - it''s when the road makes a full 180 degree turn in direction - usually while climbing up or down the mountain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TDNZvMhzaQI/AAAAAAAAJbw/-r0oAxY4_4g/s1600/notre+dame.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TDNZvMhzaQI/AAAAAAAAJbw/-r0oAxY4_4g/s400/notre+dame.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5490831038046497026&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Notre Dame de la Menour, on a mountainside in the middle of nowhere&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TDNZvcGfz_I/AAAAAAAAJb4/QHKN2Z6Ek5g/s1600/jesus.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TDNZvcGfz_I/AAAAAAAAJb4/QHKN2Z6Ek5g/s400/jesus.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5490831042226933746&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jesus still suffering - clearly the man didn''t drive up here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TDNZvq-Gd8I/AAAAAAAAJcA/I0zxYxTVYW8/s1600/coldeturini.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TDNZvq-Gd8I/AAAAAAAAJcA/I0zxYxTVYW8/s400/coldeturini.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5490831046218250178&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Around hairpin #27, I arrived at the village of Col de Turini - the high point of this section of road.

I figured I could stop counting hairpins at this point, since I was switching to a fairly straight road towards Jausiers. At least my map showed the next section of the road as being fairly straight, on the way up towards Geneva - I drove on, the road was heading up all right - in fact, this &quot;fairly straight road&quot; turned out to be Route de la Bonette - the highest road in Europe, traversing a 2,802 meter pass. It was windy, and twisty, and incredibly scenic. Adrenaline remained in high gear. The scenery now had some new additions - snow banks, spectacular views of the Alps in the distance, an occasional waterfall, and flocks of sheep crossing the road. The Megan[e] and I were excited! The diesel purred to life as I pushed the car up to the top of the 2,800m pass - that''s only the highest elevation the road reaches, I got out and climbed the last 100 meters to the top of the peak we were passing, losing a few more degrees of temperature. Suddenly my flip flops, so perfect for the beaches in Nice, seemed a little out of place... And that was before it started to rain and hail. I returned to the car a bit soaked and with some fresh concerns about the windy, twisty road heading down the mountain, now with slicker pavement. Excitement did not, however, wane very much. Fortunately, the rain did wane, as the cloud apparently extended only to the very top of the pass, as after half an hour climbing down the hill, I was once again back to a perfectly dry road. With occasional flocks of sheep, waterfalls, authentic French/Swiss Alps houses, and slow cars that gave me regular chances to push my little diesel into over-drive past them. At one point, I [briefly] found myself behind a Porsche though - he wasn''t so slow...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TDNaHq-5rwI/AAAAAAAAJc4/wpLkShY9RWE/s1600/alps.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 224px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TDNaHq-5rwI/AAAAAAAAJc4/wpLkShY9RWE/s400/alps.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5490831458538467074&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Not the Southern Alps, nor the Japanese Alps - these are the real thing!

A 35km tunnel bored into the mountainside is one of the longest in the world. Speed limit in the tunnel: 70 kph - it takes a while. Cost: $35.10 Euro! In retrrospect, I would have rather skipped it, had I known &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; was the cost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here, the Alps came to an end (the adrenaline rush lived on for a couple of days though). The mini may have made me a little leery of traveling long distances by car any more, but given a good car, and fun roads, and a relatively manageable distance, driving is still an incredibly fun way to get around! But on this day, I was done - after paying a few more tolls (you can''t really afford to drive around Europe anymore), I arrived in Geneva just in time to watch the streets explode in celebration after Brazil''s World Cup victory over Chile. There''s a few things I had imagined about the city of Geneva - crowds of Brazilians out in the streets, wildly cheering on their football team, wasn''t high on the list...&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=''1'' height=''1'' src=''https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2883997969551391628-8280258604074133860?l=safety3rd.blogspot.com'' alt='''' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;', NULL, NULL, 'Diesel Power!', 'http%3A%2F%2Fsafety3rd.blogspot.com%2F2010%2F07%2Fdiesel-power.html', 1, 'Alex', NULL, 'Millau,St Etienne de Tinee,Sospel,Roquebilliere,Nice,Ugine,Vebron,Geneva,Uzes,Oulx,Montpellier,Avignon', 3, NULL, NULL);

I felt I had the place all to myself when I went inside eleven years ago. Today, the people of America, and the people of India, and the people of everywhere in between have truly discovered Rome and the Colosseum. I''d love to see the comparison of annual visitor statistics between today and ''99 - my guess is that there''s several times more visitors that arrive today. Along with them, you get lines (of course), persistent tour guide touts, offering to get you past said lines, and Nigerian men aggressively selling crappy souvenirs. Inside today, it''s crowded - sometimes you start to think that maybe picking up a few ancient Gladiator swords and pikes and going out into the ring in order to ''thin out the crowds'' a bit wouldn''t be such a bad thing. I did have a rather profound headache that morning, following the three bottles of Italian wine Donna and I had split the night before (which didn''t feel nearly far enough in the past), so, perhaps, my judgment was a bit clouded on the ''thinning of the crowds'' issue...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other things change in less obviously perceptible ways - take the Vatican. St. Peter''s and the Piazza remain the stoic guardians of the Catholic Church, and the same steady flow of tourists comes to gawk at them. Maybe I should say torrent, not flow... but that was just as much the case eleven years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TEHiQsDn53I/AAAAAAAAJdY/G1pYdmLAvQ4/s1600/peter.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 267px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TEHiQsDn53I/AAAAAAAAJdY/G1pYdmLAvQ4/s400/peter.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5494921796700858226&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The St. Peter''s Basilica - certainly an awesome testament to Papal glory&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TEHiRvIg6YI/AAAAAAAAJd4/uTEeTILgiiQ/s1600/piazza.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 224px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TEHiRvIg6YI/AAAAAAAAJd4/uTEeTILgiiQ/s400/piazza.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5494921814706547074&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And the plaza out front...

Back in ''99, the Vatican was getting ready to welcome in the New Millennium in style and the entire Cathedral was being renovated - the outside fully encased in construction works. Having now seen it, I''ve got to admit, the Basilica is quite the site. While the architectural style is by no means unique, it is far bigger, grander, and more lavishly (much more) decorated than any of the other Catholic Cathedrals built in a similar style. The vast colonnaded plaza out front only adds to the already awe-inspiring ambiance...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vatican also houses a vast and diverse art collection - the Popes have enjoyed the good life over the years... and eventually one of them thought to turn their personal collection into a museum (and charge a steep admission fee, of course). The steep admission fee has never done much to discourage visitors, and I had planned to see the Sistine Chapel and the Musei Vaticani back in ''99, but I was confronted with a threesome of obstacles, which put together, were too much to overcome: it was 30-some degrees (Celsius), the line stretched for at least three hours, and you had to wear long pants to enter...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where things change, but subtly. You see, the line is still there, in all of its eternal glory - in fact, I think it stretches almost precisely as far as it did eleven years ago. It''s still hot, and you still have to wear long pants. But this time, I had a secret weapon (sort of like holy water, only more useful and technologically advanced) - I was staying at a hostel, the Vatican had embraced the word of the internet, and the hostel showed me how to order a ticket online. For an extra 4 Euro, you get assigned a time, show up at the Vatican at roughly that time, walk past the line, keep walking - it''s a long line, walk some more, &lt;i&gt;finally&lt;/i&gt; get to the front... &quot;Excuse me sir, I have this ticket?&quot; &quot;Oh, sure go right in - this way!&quot; That was, far and a way, the best 4 Euro I have spent in my entire life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the Vatican museums themselves... It''s not just the Sistine Chapel (as I thought going in) - it''s so very, very much more: room after room of paintings, sculpture, decorations, archaeological finds, and more. They are hard to describe, honestly, but suffice to say, the collection rivals the finest art exhibits you will find in the Louvre, in Florence, in London... The Egyptian wing may have an arguably finer collection of artifacts than the Egyptian Museum in Cairo (certainly better presented). The works by all the Italian masters are here - the decorations by Michelangelo and the Bernini''s statues all immediately jump out at you. And all it takes is standing in line for three and a half hours ... or 4 Euro.

Last time I''ve been to Pisa, I had just enough time to change trains at the station - now I was stopping here for day. Pisa was, apparently, somewhat of your basic Italian backwater town for most of its history - a Cathedral was eventually built, it burned down, it was re-built; a bell tower was added... and then the Tower began to fall over. Slowly. Very slowly - slowly enough for the citizens of Pisa to stabilize it and turn it into a world famous attraction. Today, the tower (which, by the way, is quite remarkable in appearance, aside from the unhealthy lean) continues to stand askew, but it has been stabilized, the crumbling columns have been replaced, and the gradual falling has ceased, suspending the tower in its slightly askew state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew most of the above before ever getting to Pisa. What I learned in Pisa is that there''s more to it than just the Tower - there''s a whole Piazza del Duomo: a picture-perfect plaza housing the Cathedral. It has rightfully gained the majority of its fame and notoriety for the precariously leaning tower, but the Duomo itself, along with the adjoining Campo dei Miracoli make for a remarkable medieval Italian scene in their own right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TEHjDNlcWLI/AAAAAAAAJew/Vgre3CEoVsY/s1600/torre.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TEHjDNlcWLI/AAAAAAAAJew/Vgre3CEoVsY/s400/torre.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5494922664694536370&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Look - the Tower, it leans! I wasn''t actually expecting the Tower to be as big as it is. I don''t know why, but somehow I pictured it to be smaller. In reality, it''s rather massive - easily visible along the streets before you arrive at the Piazza.

In Rome they seemed to specialize in cheap umbrellas, crappy sun glasses (and they swap displays of one for the other with remarkable speed and efficiency depending on the conditions overhead), and souvenirs, which are both cheap and crappy. In Pisa, they assault the tourists with offers of Rolexes... and crappy souvenirs. I can''t imagine why anyone would want to own a fake Rolex, no matter the price, but I did see someone negotiating on a purchase... people have weird tastes, obviously...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sites of Pisa really don''t need more than two, maybe three hours, so after snapping a few pictures of the Duomo and ducking the ''Rolex'' salesmen, I had more than enough time to get back to the hostel and settle in to watch the final qualifying round game of Italy''s national team at the World Cup, along with the Italians there. Italy played Slovakia. They had played rather uninspired football previously, so they needed a win. The Slovakians seemed unimpressed. The Italian that I was watching with, seemed despondent (and more than a little cynical) when their team was looking lethargic, down 2-1 deep into the second half. Then Italy scored a goal to tie it up! The whole street erupted in a wild, spontaneous celebration. They appeared intent to teach the South Africans just how to properly use a vuvuzelas in a time of football induced ecstasy... And then the referee ruled it a no goal (offsides - replays confirmed), and we settled into a sort of a dull stupor. In the end, Italy, a 3-2 loser to Slovakia, finished dead last in its group and failed to advance past the group stage for the first time in some 30 years. I don''t speak Italian, but I could still tell that even the TV announcers sounded depressed... It could''ve been worse, I thought - after all, the French not only failed to advance past the group stage, but their team outright mutinied against the coach. The Italians didn''t seem particularly encouraged by this neighborly comparison - I heard more about how the National Team''s coach had refused to select the Italy''s two top players for the squad - one for getting into an altercation with the coach''s son, the other for being black... It was a decidedly depressed country on this day!&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=''1'' height=''1'' src=''https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2883997969551391628-7722064762194359508?l=safety3rd.blogspot.com'' alt='''' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;', NULL, NULL, 'What a difference ten years makes', 'http%3A%2F%2Fsafety3rd.blogspot.com%2F2010%2F07%2Fwhat-difference-ten-years-makes.html', 1, 'Alex', NULL, 'Roma,Pisa', 3, NULL, NULL);

It''s the only one left of the original Seven Wonders, and they are still going strong - still gigantic, still incomprehensibly ancient. It took us as a civilization over 4,000 years to finally build a structure that was taller than the Pyramids. Egypt has gone through a succession of rulers and overlords since the Pyramids had been constructed - various ones of these lords tried to destroy or alter the Pyramids; they barely made a dent. They are as they had always been - colossal, monumental, huge, imposing... When you see them in person, they are even bigger, than you had imagined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;#2.

It''s a beautiful, gleaming, almost magical site to behold. The contrast it offers to the slums that dominate the rest of India is striking, but it doesn''t, in any way, need any extra points for the contrast - it deserves to be on any list of this kind just for its own unique and magnificent splendor. Criss-crossing India by rickshaw, getting to Agra to see the Taj Mahal was, at least, a three day detour for us, and it was easily worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;#3.

The individual temples of Thailand and Laos may be more beautiful than the less glittering Khmer architecture, but not a single one stands out in my memory quite as strikingly as the ancient Angkor Wat, towering over the jungle from its position near Siem Reap. This wasn''t the only Khmer temple I visited, and while the architectural styles are similar, none of the others could even begin to compare to Angkor Wat on sheer size and scale. It''s huge, and it just peaks out of the jungle, with a subtle air of mystery, as if a real-life Angelina Jolie - Tomb Raider really is going to emerge from behind the trees any second. It''s a stark contrast to Giza, where the Pyramids have been all but swallowed up by the metropolis of Cairo. Of course, Siem Reap isn''t much of a metropolis, and Cambodia rolls along at a much slower, quieter pace than Egypt anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;#4.

A lot of the structures here were more of the same too (not &lt;b&gt;another&lt;/b&gt; five story pagoda!?), but, Kyoto did have a few that very much broke the mold and inspired the imagination. Tops among them is the Golden Pavilion. Actually, I think, it''s the golden reflection in the perfectly calm waters, on a clear winter day, that truly sold me. The stark green forest background surely made it one of the most photogenic sites in Japan...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;#5.

That would be the Eiffel Tower. I think we are all pretty familiar with it by now, so I don''t need to try and wax poetic about it - it''s the avant garde symbol of modern day France. While Notre Dame, Versailles, and Louvre were the gleaming, golden symbols that the French royalty erected to celebrate their rule, the modern, and relatively spartan in decoration, Eiffel Tower is the symbol of Paris, and of France that I think of. In fact, it''s the on the very, very short list of the most striking and memorable sites in all of Europe that immediately come to mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;#6.

Maybe I overlook the Moscow sites because I take them for granted, having grown up there. I don''t know, but while Europe boasts plenty of amazing churches and cathedrals, none is quite as unique as Moscow''s St. Basil''s with its assortment of beautifully multi-colored domes. Even the other Russian Orthodox churches don''t look like this, with their always golden cupolas, and I did emphasize uniqueness among my criteria!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;#7.

Skyscrapers have really become symbols of modern architecture, but they are really not &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; different from each other. Sydney''s Opera House is absolutely unique in its contemporary combination of function and design - sails blowing in the wind, as it''s coming in from the harbor. The Eiffel Tower was reviled when first constructed, Shanghai''s Oriental Pearl Tower remains ugly, but I doubt anyone didn''t admire the beauty and elegance of the Sydney Opera House from the moment it had been completed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that''s the list! There''s plenty I haven''t seen yet - the Mayan and Aztec Pyramids, the brand new Burj Dubai Tower, the Moai of Easter Island, even America''s very own Mt. Rushmore, just off the top of my head, so I may, some day, decide to adjust the list, but, for now, I''m quite happy with it. Some notable runners-up that didn''t quite make the cut:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - The churches of Western Europe: &lt;a href=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v466/29/100/1046387715/n1046387715_30215917_8184.jpg&quot;&gt;Notre Dame&lt;/a&gt; in Paris, London''s &lt;a href=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc3/hs365.snc3/23540_1374267470506_1046387715_31150996_7620696_n.jpg&quot;&gt;Westminster Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TEHiQsDn53I/AAAAAAAAJdY/G1pYdmLAvQ4/s1600/peter.JPG&quot;&gt;St. Peter''s Basilica&lt;/a&gt; at the heart of the Vatican, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v466/29/100/1046387715/n1046387715_30215972_498.jpg&quot;&gt;Sagrada Famillia&lt;/a&gt; in Barcelona. None of them quite stood out and separated themselves enough from other similar Cathedrals, in my mind. Sagrada Famillia has a chance, as it''s still under construction...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/SfY4OQd_eiI/AAAAAAAAGr8/h5optSeZRhA/s1600-h/machu.JPG&quot;&gt;Machu Picchu&lt;/a&gt; is awesome, but it is in large part awesome because it''s the ''Lost City of the Incas'' and because of its amazing surroundings in the Peruvian mountains. But the actual Incan architecture, especially minus all the gold, that conquistadors so kindly removed/stole, isn''t quite astounding enough. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/potalamtns.JPG&quot;&gt;Potala Palace&lt;/a&gt; in Tibet falls into the same category - it''s mystical and full of history and tradition, but as far as the actual architecture and decoration, I didn''t think it was quite up to par. Very compellingly close though...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Thailand and Burma each has a plethora of amazing temples, but they are hard to separate from each other. As a whole, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v466/29/100/1046387715/n1046387715_30215832_9997.jpg&quot;&gt;Bangkok&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.safety3rdblog.com/img/blog/balloons.JPG&quot;&gt;plane of Bagan&lt;/a&gt; are amazing, but I can''t pick an individual temple over the likes of Angkor Wat, Taj Mahal, and Kyoto''s Golden Pavilion. In a similar vein, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v466/29/100/1046387715/n1046387715_30215920_9180.jpg&quot;&gt;Istanbul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TCTgs4XO42I/AAAAAAAAJV4/Z04FtlUJnyQ/s400/muhamedali.JPG&quot;&gt;Cairo&lt;/a&gt;, and [especially] &lt;a href=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v466/29/100/1046387715/n1046387715_30215927_1487.jpg&quot;&gt;Samarquand&lt;/a&gt; had some amazing Islamic architecture - from the massive spires of the minarets of Istanbul and Cairo to the ancient, mosaic''d madrassahs of Samarquand and &lt;a href=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v466/29/100/1046387715/n1046387715_30215926_1147.jpg&quot;&gt;Buchara&lt;/a&gt;, but that left each of them just good enough to merit mention among the runners-up category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - Finally, the modern world gives us the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-ash1/v258/29/100/1046387715/n1046387715_30060760_7240.jpg&quot;&gt;Petronas Towers&lt;/a&gt; of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v2568/29/100/1046387715/n1046387715_30359348_6726945.jpg&quot;&gt;Yokohama Landmark Tower&lt;/a&gt; in Japan, &lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/Sn_Jwu1bVnI/AAAAAAAAIVo/84c5CLkSL80/s1600-h/bidge.jpg&quot;&gt;San Francisco''s Golden Gate Bridge&lt;/a&gt;, and even the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v2620/29/100/1046387715/n1046387715_30369718_2695394.jpg&quot;&gt;Flora General&lt;/a&gt; of Buenos Aires (among others), but amazing as each of those is, I don''t think they crack the top seven of amazing!&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=''1'' height=''1'' src=''https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2883997969551391628-3637021378894979864?l=safety3rd.blogspot.com'' alt='''' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;', NULL, NULL, 'The Seven Wonders of the World', 'http%3A%2F%2Fsafety3rd.blogspot.com%2F2010%2F07%2Fseven-wonders-of-world.html', 1, 'Alex', NULL, 'Kyoto,Paris,Agra,Siem Reap,Moscow,Cairo,Sydney', 3, NULL, NULL);

Taking the ferry to Liberty Island itself was expensive and entailed an hour+ wait. Taking the Staten Island Ferry, which goes right by the Statue, was free and had no wait, plus the huge orange ships were pretty cool, so I followed my aunt''s advice and did a commuter drive-by visit to the Statue.

Besides, the pizzas are rather sizeable - Lombardi''s claims to be the original pizzeria and is a well-established tourist haunt, as the place had been recommended by Jamie, all the way back in London... Somebody else had suggested Lombardi''s to Michelle too - she''s an interesting girl: had just graduated from Texas A&amp;M University and is at the moment doing an ''Eight Jobs in Eight Weeks'' program, where, you guessed it, you work eight different jobs in eight weeks, in eight different cities. Writing a blog and everything and presumably figuring out what you want to do with your life now that college is over, and you are supposedly about to become responsible. She now has a video of me on the blog going on about how you should just travel instead of becoming responsible, but I can''t possibly imagine that I sound particularly coherent, so I''ll leave finding that blog as an exercise for the reader...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TE2shgX8HgI/AAAAAAAAJg4/nRRXxGRqNSE/s1600/oz.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 118px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TE2shgX8HgI/AAAAAAAAJg4/nRRXxGRqNSE/s400/oz.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5498240411715247618&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And then I went to see Wicked&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept hearing about how good the show was, but had missed it when it was playing in Seattle (and then again in London), so I was happy to catch the permanent production on Broadway.

(At about 3 in the morning - Greyhound is not your friend!) What did I know about Montreal prior to arriving? They speak French a lot, and I have friends to visit there - that''s about it. The last guidebook I had been traveling with was for Egypt, so I''d become rather open-minded about the places I was getting to these days. So, the following day, having met up with Goose and Sara (at 3 the previous morning), I headed off to explore this new Franco-English speaking land. And the first thing I found along the way? Well, apparently, hippies - proper, frisbee throwing, hacky sack playing, tambourine drumming, weed offering hippies! You''d think you were in San Francisco or Seattle again - I figured I could get along with the people here! No matter which language they spoke...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First stop was the Parque Mont Royal, which, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://montrealtamtams.com/&quot;&gt;their website describes&lt;/a&gt;, hosts a popular activity called the &quot;Montreal Tam Tam Jam:&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TFIltXz99pI/AAAAAAAAJiI/Zdbd1D0SMeQ/s1600/tamtam.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TFIltXz99pI/AAAAAAAAJiI/Zdbd1D0SMeQ/s400/tamtam.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5499499556389123730&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It consists of lots of people drumming away on these hand drums (&quot;tam-tams&quot; in French).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TFIlt_cPGPI/AAAAAAAAJiQ/zvm7K_e_pWg/s1600/danceuse.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TFIlt_cPGPI/AAAAAAAAJiQ/zvm7K_e_pWg/s400/danceuse.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5499499567027001586&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And of others dancing to the rhythms&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was kind of crazy, kind of cool, but it gets better! I headed deeper into the forest (park), in search of Sunday''s star attraction - the ''fighting geeks,'' as Sara and Goose described them. They aren''t hard to find - quite an audience had gathered, so pretty soon I was in a large-ish clearing, watching the following spectacle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TFIlsgDqKII/AAAAAAAAJh4/H_maQzgRQNs/s1600/fight.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TFIlsgDqKII/AAAAAAAAJh4/H_maQzgRQNs/s400/fight.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5499499541422549122&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TFIltP1-TaI/AAAAAAAAJiA/HCiHHcz0Mgw/s1600/swords.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 267px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TFIltP1-TaI/AAAAAAAAJiA/HCiHHcz0Mgw/s400/swords.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5499499554250050978&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;These guys, sadly, do not have a website explaining what it is that they are all about (that I know of - in reality they likely do). But how much of an explanation do we really need? It''s a collection of twenty to fifty guys (and girls) who go at each other, utilizing plastic pikes and swords, wrapped in foam! Pretty straightforward, makes for quite a spectacle. While some of it certainly looks like vaguely organized mayhem, quite a few of the participants looked to have a fair bit of actual fencing background - a ''noob'' couldn''t even touch me, man! On Halloween a couple of years ago, they did apparently get attacked by a crowd of zombies though... I do ever so wish I had been there to witness that battle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving on from the semi-, vaguely-serious to the purely comedic, The Just for Laughs Festival was just finishing up in town that Sunday too.

Montreal used to be Canada''s primary Atlantic port as the lakes and rivers connect it all the way to the ocean, but the major ports have moved even further inland along the Great Lakes these days. Apparently, at the turn of the last century, it was also a significant manufacturing and shipping hub - a fact you won''t be able to miss while gazing at some of the architecture that highlights the Old Port area:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TFIl7f6lGEI/AAAAAAAAJjA/-BadiHyNlJI/s1600/silo.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TFIl7f6lGEI/AAAAAAAAJjA/-BadiHyNlJI/s400/silo.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5499499799082506306&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TFIl6e89duI/AAAAAAAAJio/bDOidEdeG4g/s1600/elevator.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TFIl6e89duI/AAAAAAAAJio/bDOidEdeG4g/s400/elevator.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5499499781644187362&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Then again, they might just all be hippies, so they like having all these grain silos still around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TFImPkMYuYI/AAAAAAAAJjI/hNLctMsrKck/s1600/house.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TFImPkMYuYI/AAAAAAAAJjI/hNLctMsrKck/s400/house.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5499500143828318594&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I mean somebody had to have designed this housing complex, and I''m fairly certain they were high!

I was staying with Tim, with whom I had previously met up traveling in Mendoza, Argentina (wine tasting) and Hong Kong (Chinese food! No, not the tourist crap, &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; Chinese food). Toronto was sort of a combination of the two - from ethnically diverse including Indian and Chinese Dim Sum, to Cora''s for breakfast, to trout and goat cheese mashed potatoes Tim and Whelena had collaborated on (btw, goat cheese + mashed potatoes = really good) to wine tastings along with local cheese in the Niagara Valley... But I''m trying to keep a theme here, so we''re focusing on the indie music at this point! I''ll have to get back to the Toronto attractions like the CN Tower in another post... Montreal, by the way, does quite well on the culinary front itself, chiming in with poutine - I have now come to accept french fries with gravy, cheese curds, and a variety of additional toppings as a very worthwhile addition to the culinary world from the nation of Canada...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually both Montreal and Toronto have some claims to dining fame - Toronto is often described as having the most diverse choice of cuisines available in any city in North America, if not the whole world, while Montreal is said to have the most restaurants per capita.

I went horse back riding in a few places too, but that hardly looks like a sport when I''m the one doing it...

The Iguazu falls in Argentina are undoubtedly the most awesome waterfall (or a collection of falls rather) in the world.

This was, incidentally, my first time in South Dakota too...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rushmore is absolutely unique - I''ve been trying to think of something to compare it to, but there really isn''t anything. The monuments are huge - the faces are each sixty feet tall, and they are carved into one of the tallest peaks in the park. There are, of course, other giant monuments around the world, but all the ones I can think of fall neatly into two distinct categories: religious shines (topped perhaps by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhas_of_Bamyan&quot;&gt;The Buddhas of Bayman&lt;/a&gt; in Afghanistan... until the Taliban destroyed them in 2001), or pure cults of personality - my favorite is certainly the giant &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hitxp.com/articles/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Turkmen1.jpg&quot;&gt;golden Turkmenbashi&lt;/a&gt; sun dial in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan. (Holy Crap - &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.rian.ru/exsoviet/20100617/159457446.html&quot;&gt;they are taking down the Golden Turkmenbashi&lt;/a&gt;!) Mount Rushmore, however, is neither religious in nature, nor was it constructed to immortalize those building it (or at least authorizing the construction), which, I think, makes it pretty uniquely American. The four Presidents depicted are (from left to right) George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. I think it''s safe to say these four were already pretty well immortalized in American history books by the time the monument was completed in 1939. In a related sign of an American oxymoron, accessing Mount Rushmore is free of charge (something that would be inconceivable just about anywhere else in the world) - the parking lot, on the other hand, is privately run and will set you back ten dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TF-wiSuyOaI/AAAAAAAAJmg/NjgnQU9GNyk/s1600/alexrush.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TF-wiSuyOaI/AAAAAAAAJmg/NjgnQU9GNyk/s400/alexrush.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5503311372860144034&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In defense of my rather grizzly appearance I''ll note that the previous two nights had been spent in a seat on board an amtrak train and in a tent in the South Dakota wilderness. Was starting to look forward to my Denver hotel room by now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a mildly ironic twist of fate, Mount Rushmore, this most iconic of All-American monuments is actually located on what has traditionally been Native American land - Sioux land, specifically. Perhaps as a result (or in response?), the tribes are banding together to erect a commemorative monument of their own, not far from Mount Rushmore - Crazy Horse. And you''ve got to give them credit - they are dreaming big! The mountain chosen as the site, is one of the few that''s taller than Rushmore in the area, and, as planned, Crazy Horse will become the tallest monument currently in existence in the world. Now I say ''currently in existence'' because they are nowhere near completion - in fact, at the rate they are going (10 workers at the site, not accepting any money from the US government to help with the construction), it is estimated that the monument will take another &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;hundred and fifty years&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to complete... Nothing highlights your imminent mortality quite like being on a bus and being told that none of you on board, not even the youngest children, will live long enough to see the completed structure, assuming they stick to the current pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TF-wh5AbphI/AAAAAAAAJmQ/haF_edBalIs/s1600/crazy.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TF-wh5AbphI/AAAAAAAAJmQ/haF_edBalIs/s400/crazy.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5503311365954840082&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;So far, we''ve completed Crazy Horse''s face - this took about 50 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TF-wiBUhiJI/AAAAAAAAJmY/TcrQLEZEDGo/s1600/whole.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TF-wiBUhiJI/AAAAAAAAJmY/TcrQLEZEDGo/s400/whole.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5503311368186595474&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The envisioned model of the entire structure - just another 150 short years! I am a little curious about the slow pace - if money was the only obstacle, you''d think with all the money the tribal casinos are bringing in these days all over the country, that would be an imminently resolvable problem?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assuming the final statue is eventually carved to the design originally envisioned, will it be the largest monument in the world when eventually finished? Hard to say - China and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.maitreyaproject.org/en/index.html&quot;&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; currently have competing projects to erect the tallest Buddha statue, but neither reaches the projected height of Crazy Horse (560 feet, or about 171 meters), but what will happen over the next 150 years, assuming it really takes that long? Noone knows for certain... but unless the Taliban come to power in more parts of the world, I think it''s safe to say there will be more statues getting erected, and given a century and a half, 171 meters may not be an entirely indomitable limit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so, after seeing the two monuments, each representing a different take on the notion of All-American, it was time to pack up my tent and head back to Denver. Now Denver is about a six hour drive from Mount Rushmore; the road passes through parts of Colorado, Wyoming, and South Dakota along the way... and lemme tell you this ain''t the most scenic drive you''ll ever take! In fact, unless you are a big fan of vast, flat open spaces and really, really, really straight roads, you may grow kinda bored along the way - I surely did. At least the speed limit on the interstates in 75 mph - they clearly know just how straight, flat, and devoid of compelling scenery the roads are. The immediate area surrounding Mount Rushmore and Crazy Horse is legitimately beautiful of course - the lush greens of the Black Hills National Forest and Custer State Part, interspersed with a variety of lakes, rivers, and scraggy mountain ranges... But as soon as you leave those behind, you are left with, well, flatness.

It probably added another hour or two to the drive back, but I figured as long as I was nearby, it would be a shame to miss it. Plus, it gave me a chance to drive along I-90 for some 30 miles, and that made it feel almost like home (I-90 proceeds all the way West to Seattle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don''t know a whole lot about Devils Tower honestly - it looks like the neck of a big volcano... and it looks that way no matter how close you are to it, so I didn''t see the point of paying to actually enter the grounds of the national park. I''ve since read that it''s actually possible to climb to the top of the Tower, which would have certainly been cool, but I didn''t really have time to do it anyway, so back to Denver I went!

After filling up, I turned out around, pulled back out onto the highway, and sent my little Hyundai on its way back South... Then things went into slow motion in my head - hey, there''s a big white car parked on the side of the road - Crap! It''s a cop! - Was I speeding? I wonder how fast I was going? I''ve no idea what the speed limit in the town of Hulett is! - Fuck! He''s pulling out - lights on... So, I was speeding. Technically, if he had waited, he may have had a better catch as I was speeding up (probably not much better though, as I did notice him and slowed back down), but as it turned out, the speed limit in tiny little outposts of civilization (e.g. Hulett; population: 516) in rural Wyoming (is there another kind of Wyoming?) is 30 mph, and I was doing 41.

I noted that the CT scanner looked a little like a time machine... I was seriously bored by this time: they ended up keeping me at the hospital for about five hours - Harborview was busy! and thus slow...

Somewhere on the train ride to Denver, a plan was hatched: upon reaching Seattle, I''d keep heading further West and make it across the bay to Victoria and we''d hang out on Vancouver Island for a day. After all, I still had some Canadian cash on hand! More importantly, the following conversation had become all too common of a refrain while I''d been traveling:&lt;br /&gt; - And where are you from?&lt;br /&gt; - Seattle, in the US&lt;br /&gt; - Oh, I visited there - it''s beautiful! How do you like Victoria? We thought it was really lovely!&lt;br /&gt; - Well, actually, I still haven''t been to Victoria or Vancouver Island... &amp;lt;frowny face&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;And catching up with Lara, and her funny Australian accent would be cool too, so after spending Friday in Seattle, I was off again, to nearby Canada bright and early on Saturday morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A three hour ferry ride and 45 minute wait for immigration later, and I was back in Canada! Victoria itself is rather peaceful, and pretty, and quiet. It certainly has a pronounced quaint Victorian feel to it (duh!), especially in the summer - with the immaculate houses, lots of flowers, and the imposing Parliament building&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TGuFzHM4Q7I/AAAAAAAAJo4/zH3hXVl35OQ/s1600/flowers.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TGuFzHM4Q7I/AAAAAAAAJo4/zH3hXVl35OQ/s400/flowers.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5506642082543453106&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Like I said, lots of pretty, brightly-colored flowers! Right in front of Parliament...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of Vancouver Island, the largest island on the Pacific side of North America (and the 43rd largest island in the world - thanks, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_islands_by_area&quot;&gt;wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;!) is a pretty big adventure destination - from hiking to surfing to bungy jumping, you''ve got it all available, but I was only here for a day, so there weren''t any big outdoorsy adventures on the schedule (other than camping overnight). We did our loop around Victoria, then went for a brief hike, more of a stroll rather, in a park, which hugged the jagged shoreline of a medium-sized lake in the suburbs of Victoria. I can''t remember the name of the park or of the lake, but I do remember getting completely disoriented during the hike because the lake is a very, very irregular non-geometric shape... Anyway, I digress, following this non-geometric shape of a lake, we headed off to the Butchart Gardens, arguably the best known attraction of Vancouver Island. The gardens are an enormous, sprawling collection of flower beds, begun by Mrs. Butchart early in the 20th century. When you enter, you get a flower guide, which among other trivia, tells you when the flowers are likely to be in bloom - flowers being what they are, just about everything is in bloom in July/August, so you too should be coming to visit right about now:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TGuFzsg0VRI/AAAAAAAAJpI/JEtJ-Wa37UQ/s1600/purple.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TGuFzsg0VRI/AAAAAAAAJpI/JEtJ-Wa37UQ/s400/purple.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5506642092559193362&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There''s pretty purple flowers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TGuF0IJfChI/AAAAAAAAJpQ/4DdYFHNONDk/s1600/white.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TGuF0IJfChI/AAAAAAAAJpQ/4DdYFHNONDk/s400/white.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5506642099977521682&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And really nice white ones...

The Canadians are very polite - they really are renowned for it all over the world. Consequently you get all the idiot Americans parading around Europe with Canadian patches on their backpacks, thinking that''ll make them appear slightly less obnoxious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was starting to get a little dark by this time, which was very good news, indeed - it was a Saturday, and as we discovered, The Butchart Gardens puts on a big fireworks display every Saturday in the summer. And this isn''t just a shoot all sorts of sparklies into the sky, like we do for Fourth of July (or the Chinese do for Chinese New Year... they do a lot more actually!) - this is more of an old-school show: there''s both the normal fireworks lighting up the skies, and lots of animated, firework-ed displays performing little song and dance tricks down on the ground.

In the morning, we caught a car ferry back to the States via Anacortes, which took long enough to frustrate and annoy me, but we did make it back to Seattle just in time to go get my furniture out of storage and get me moved in to my new place on Capitol Hill. All in all, a success then! If the ferry had taken another 45 minutes, my storage would''ve closed, and this success would have turned into a spectacular failure, so I like to think I was justified for wishing that the American Customs would move a little faster, but they are world-renowned for being slow and [often excessively] thorough these days.

Though Seattle''s very own Safeco Field is up there too), but I had never seen either of the two oldest, venerable, most famous stadiums in the major leagues: Boston''s Fenway Park, where the Red Sox play, and Wrigley Field, on the North side of Chicago, home of the green ivy and your favorite lovable losers, the Cubs.

I would''ve actually been more excited to see the old, more historic Yankee Stadium, but that had been replaced by this shining new stadium last year, so that''s what we get. I would have been really, really excited to catch a game here (or even at the new Mets Stadium in Queens), but I happened to be in New York during baseball''s All Star break, so no games for you!

I stuck with it though, waited out the delay, taking a chance to explore the stadium, and sample the local bratwurst offerings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An hour later, the action resumed, and we all trooped back to our seats. Sadly, the weather didn''t get the memo that we were all back, while the umpires were clearly inclined to try and get the game finished, so we were experiencing a little more New England drizzle than I felt I had really signed up for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/THmwwT8pWxI/AAAAAAAAJqY/NSTdzD8F4do/s1600/clouds.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/THmwwT8pWxI/AAAAAAAAJqY/NSTdzD8F4do/s400/clouds.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5510629963099364114&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The skies continuing to look ominous over Fenway&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put up with the rain for about another inning, and promptly packed up and headed out of the stadium - I''m all for catching a Sox game at Fenway, but getting soaked wasn''t part of the plan. Fenway itself was really cool to see - it''s certainly very small, very cozy, distinctly old school. The fans used to be known as the most knowledgeable baseball fans in America - as the ticket prices have risen sharply, the most die-hard, most knowledgeable fans have stopped being able to afford tickets, so while there still isn''t an empty seat to be found in the house, I didn''t necessarily think the makeup of the crowd was any different than what you''d expect at a baseball game anywhere else around the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And speaking of anywhere else around the country, a couple of weeks later, after a detour through Canada, I reached Chicago, home of the Cubs. I was once again here for just a single night, staying with Ellen, a new couch-surfing buddy, and we headed off towards Wrigley Field to catch an evening game against the St. Louis Cardinals (somewhat ironically, last time I had been in St. Louis, I caught a game there against the Cubs...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/THmw-jiIy6I/AAAAAAAAJqw/nIOfYe-ivj8/s1600/cubs.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/THmw-jiIy6I/AAAAAAAAJqw/nIOfYe-ivj8/s400/cubs.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5510630207801314210&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Approaching Wrigley!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/THmw-7iFUKI/AAAAAAAAJq4/a89h-RubWXI/s1600/ellen.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/THmw-7iFUKI/AAAAAAAAJq4/a89h-RubWXI/s400/ellen.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5510630214243537058&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Ellen and I over by our ''seats'' - all the games at Wrigley are sold out too, so we ended up with standing room seats, which was actually just fine by us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/THmxaTR9Y5I/AAAAAAAAJrA/wyuM6dbYJGM/s1600/pujols.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/THmxaTR9Y5I/AAAAAAAAJrA/wyuM6dbYJGM/s400/pujols.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5510630684474827666&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;National League MVP Albert Pujols taking a swing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/THmxaoQCNNI/AAAAAAAAJrI/UktUKg71mYM/s1600/ivy.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/THmxaoQCNNI/AAAAAAAAJrI/UktUKg71mYM/s400/ivy.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5510630690103899346&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;''Beyond the Ivy'' seats - Wrigley Field feels really small!

Wrigley Field, I enjoyed even more than Fenway - they are both small, cozy and somehow feel closer and more genuine than most of the gigantic, new, corporate-sponsored stadiums, but Wrigley has a little more of a quiet, relaxed vibe to it than does Fenway. Maybe it''s just the ivy on the outfield walls, or maybe it''s because the Cubs are the lovable losers (last championship in 1908, next one does not currently appear to be imminent), while the Red Sox have become all smug, corporate, and expensive(!) after breaking through their own curse (read: cheapness of a former owner) and winning a pair of World Series titles in the past ten years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that, in short, was my America''s Pastime baseball experience. Some day, catching a game at the two New York stadiums needs to happen, but I''ve gotten the two venues that I really wanted to see out of the way: Fenway and Wrigley! Oh, and I did pass by some other baseball venues along the way, but I wasn''t quite so inclined to catch a game at either one of these:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/THmw-WRrqzI/AAAAAAAAJqo/jnlTDi-o00Y/s1600/rogers.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 300px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/THmw-WRrqzI/AAAAAAAAJqo/jnlTDi-o00Y/s400/rogers.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5510630204242635570&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Some fun decorations on the side of the Rogers Stadium in downtown Toronto - generally regarded as a particularly unattractive stadium...

INSERT INTO `rr2008_msgs` VALUES (494, '2010-09-10 07:14:00', NULL, 'Burning Man defies explanation - I feel words will absolutely, utterly fail to do it justice. Trying to get a grasp on it, without having gone, pictures will only mislead and confuse - the place is simply too enormous, too vast, too diverse to capture in any photograph. But, it is absolutely amazing. From the setting in the middle of a hot, barren, and foreboding Nevada desert, to all the very, very different people who come to witness it, to all the amazing and ridiculous art installations, and to its final culmination on Saturday and Sunday nights when the Man and the Temple burn - no matter where you turn, where you look, you never fail to be surprised, to see something downright amazing, never-failingly absolutely unique going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a few of the things that happened in Black Rock City - in no particular order, in no way suggesting that these are special, this is just what is likely to happen to you at Burning Man - normal parts of ''every day life'' here, which make the place as unique and amazing as it is. I watched water burn, I rode a mutant city bus with a large ship installed on top of it, I walked a tight rope, I was shocked by one Joule of energy, which I had myself generated, I stripped off my clothes to do a dance in exchange for an early morning mimosa, I watched people fight in the ThunderDome, I climbed a tower that would''ve been deemed exceedingly dangerous to be climbed anywhere outside of Black Rock City, I found the fence in the middle of the night, then walked along it looking for corners, finally finding a movie theater in the middle of the desert, and settling in to watch the sun rise at a nearby bus stop ... where an hour later, a bus came by to pick us up, delivering the happiest moment of the week. I slept for an average of three hours a night, I inhaled an inordinate amount of dust from the air every day, I didn''t shower, I watched my deodorant actually melt... I was ready to leave when Sunday rolled around, yet I was eager to go back as soon as we were confronted with civilization outside of Black Rock City. I felt free, unrestrained and happy the whole time there! I hung out with some of the most wonderful and interesting people you''ll find anywhere on this planet...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We arrived late Tuesday night after a full day drive from Portland, Oregon. Our driver, the dominatrix (yes, that is her actual profession... seemed completely natural, unsurprising, and downright par for the course for this place) pulled up to the gate, presented all of our tickets and shared that she had two BM virgins on board - Laurie and I marched out, feeling just a little bewildered, each rang the gong, then proceeded to roll around in the dust, making a Playa angel and becoming one with the environment. A gigantic yellow moon hung low over us looking in on the spectacle, as an hour long cavalcade of cars was lining up for entry - on Sunday night, the wait had been six grueling hours(!). We found a parking spot on the outskirts of the sprawling Metropolis and wandered into the heart of town. Kyoto street to the center actually felt a lot closer than I had imagined, then rational thoughts ceased to be formed - we rode the Surly Bird around the Playa, passing a brightly lit Butterfly car and a preening Prey Mantis showing off the incredible detail its designers had dedicated to it. We saw The Man, holding its high and central position over the Playa. Laurie and I, the virgins, quietly tried to take it all in - I was absorbing the spectacle slowly, rationally, not feeling overwhelmed just yet, simply finding the scene around us astounding, ridiculous, bewildering. By the time we returned to the RV and went to sleep at 3 in the morning, the crowds had not thinned out at all, the music had not quieted down a single decibel, and the bright, screaming lights in the middle of this desert, a completely desolate piece of land for 51 out of the 52 weeks of the year, did not dim one bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following morning, our happy Portland RV crew split up and we each went to our respective camps. I found Camp Caribbean, met Irina, proceeded to set up my tent ... which suddenly seemed awfully insufficient to house me and all of my things... a week''s worth of food, water, clothing, and more. Irina and I headed off to explore the Metropolis in day light - and now, it really begins to blow your mind - there was just too much going on all around! The center of the Playa was closer than I had expected, but the encampment seemed to sprawl forever all around it. The landscape was dotted with insane art cars, incomprehensible, yet often gorgeous, art pieces ... camps that had their own decorations, their own entertainment options, their own food and drink, all of which they were ready to share with you. There''s no money on the Playa - you bring things and you share them with the rest of the Black Rock City population, freely and happily. And in the end, free and happy were the strongest emotions that were on display here - you can do anything you want and you, and everyone around you, will be happy about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The Paradox in the desert&lt;/span&gt; - late Saturday night, the Man was set to burn! The biggest party in this week of partying over-indulgence, and its biggest oxymoron - we had all gathered to camp in this wild and desolate place, supplying all of our own food, water, power, garbage collection, and on this night, 50,000 people had gathered in the middle of the Playa, looking up at The Man, and surrounded by all the sites and sounds of civilization that you should never expect out here! The Man was surrounded by a ring of Art Cars, their music blaring loudly, their lights shining brightly, the drinks on board flowing freely. It was the one party that brought all of us together, making us feel like we weren''t in the wild desert at all, but instead at an ornate celebration of our freedom, our freedom to incinerate the very symbol of the place that we had all come to see. Then the fireworks went off, blanketing the statue in their high-tech trails, making you forget about the desert setting that much more, until the flames were unleashed, and leapt up towards the statue, bringing with them a sense of wild nature here in the middle of the night on the Playa; consuming the giant statue in a matter of twenty minutes. The following night, the Temple followed the Man in its fiery course... but the Temple is the spiritual centerpiece of the Playa, and the setting was dramatically different - the Art Cars still patrolled in the background, but the sound systems were off, the lights subdued, the crowds relatively quiet... right up until the last of the Temple tumbled down onto the pile of ashes and glowing ambers, and a primal scream was unleashed... And then we got up and headed back for our camps and vehicles as it was time to leave. For those staying the night, the City remained vibrantly awash in light and sound, drawing in anyone still with the strength and endurance for another night of mayhem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, Evone, Steve, and I were in our U-Haul truck heading out of the City and on through the night towards San Francisco. Passing the entrance gates in short order, and then, thrust into a continuous traffic jam waiting, struggling to get back onto the paved roads, almost as if the real world was balking at letting us back in. For the three of us it went something like this: we''d pull up to the car in front of us and stop, waiting for it to move again. Which it would do some five to ten minutes later. Which was plenty of time for all three of us to fall asleep. Now, there would be some hundred feet of open dirt between us and the car ahead and either Evone would wake up first and get us up there, or one of Steve and I would wake up, nudge Evone, and we''d go. Rinse and repeat for some three hours until we finally hit the highway and were able to continuously move again, which seemed to help keep Evone focused and awake (while letting Steve and I simply pass out). The Denny''s stop in Reno at 4:30 in the morning (along with every other car that had left Black Rock City that night) was a God-send!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, what can I say about the Burning Man experience? In some ways, it did meet some of my expectations - I''m not entirely comfortable dealing with large crowds of people, and being thrust into a crowd of [mostly] strangers, fifty thousand strong, was a bit of a shock. On the other hand, in a lot of ways it exceeded a lot of my expectations - the over-riding feeling I got from everyone there was that of being happy and free, which was amazing, and made it easy and comfortable to get along with these thousands of happy and free strangers. The art, I also hadn''t expected (how could you, really!?) - there''s so much of of it ... everywhere and all around, it''s incredible, astoundingly detailed and brilliantly designed, and all marvelously well fitting with the theme of the Metropolis (the Playa art tour was one of my favorite experiences of the week). As for all the expected downsides - the dust, the heat, the cold at night, the lack of showers? This didn''t really register - maybe it was the lack of sleep (leading to lack of focus... or was it the alcohol that led to the constant lack of focus?), maybe I was just used to harsh conditions from places like Mongolia, Egypt, Nepal, Bolivia, etc, but I was able to take the harsh environment in stride... Not to say that I enjoyed the harshness of it - the first shower back in the real world, upon reaching San Francisco, felt like the most wonderful, healing, relaxing, profoundly existential experience, but, while there, I felt I could handle the intense conditions the desert threw at us. So, will there be a sequel next year? Much too early to tell - I''m intrigued about going back into that foreboding environment, meeting again the amazing people I had met this year, and finding more new ones... Then again, I might actually have a real job by next year, so will I be able to just take a week off? Will I want to go through the nightmare of logistics and planning again? What about the dust, heat, desolation, etc... conditions were actually far milder than normal this year? I don''t know yet - I made up mind to go all of two weeks prior to the start this year, I''ll probably let it go just about that long again next year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pictures... They still certainly fail to put anything into proper perspective, but that didn''t keep me from taking lots of them.

So between being relatively familiar with the place, and still trying re-integrate myself into the real world, I didn''t particularly feel like playing tourist was to be my primary goal here - it fit in safely somewhere right behind resting/showering/catching my breath and meeting up with friends. However, by Day 2, I was feeling mildly recovered (physically anyway - mind remained a bit cloudy for at least another week), and the little tourist voice in the back of my head started singing its song again... it actually just kept saying one word over and over: Alcatraz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TJXR0TPDc3I/AAAAAAAAJtA/L56eAic8vCs/s1600/alcatraz.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 267px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TJXR0TPDc3I/AAAAAAAAJtA/L56eAic8vCs/s400/alcatraz.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5518547614859228018&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The Rock! It may be the best know of San Francisco''s attractions, and I''d kept missing it on each of the previous visits&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how much I need to say about Alcatraz - it''s only the most famous (and infamous) of American prisons, and it was in operation for a mere 29 years (1934-1963). It housed some of the most famous and notorious convicts of its day - starting with Al Capone back in the 30''s. Noone is known to have successfully escaped. If you are curious to learn more, I recommend a trip to San Francisco and a visit to the Rock - the audio tour gives you a pretty good account of the island''s history, including the times before, after, and of course, during its time as a Federal prison. The tour is quite well put together, and I actually found the narrative a lot more interesting than most audio guides of this sort. Some things I knew (life in America''s most secure prison wasn''t a whole lot of fun, but nobody is known to have successfully escaped), some I suspected (the island started life as a fortification for the San Francisco Bay back in the mid-19th century), and some I''d been completely oblivious of (The Rock was a site of an intense native American protest back in the 70''s, lasting over a year, and while the Native Americans failed to get custody of Alcatraz, the incident did, apparently, accelerate the programs to transfer more tribal lands back to their original, tribal owners... who have since proceeded to erect gleaming, shining casinos on said tribal lands... but I digress...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as I said, if you want the full history of the place, I recommend a visit, or you can at least start with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcatraz_Island&quot;&gt;wikipedia  page&lt;/a&gt;.

They do maintain and protect the Rock''s greenery, and apparently the island is an important nesting habitat for several species of birds in the Bay...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I spent about three hours on the island, roaming about, taking in the narrative, observing the very multi-cultured collection of tourists on the island, and watching the weather undergo a dramatic transformation from standard Bay Area gray to sunny, with dramatic blue skies. By 6, I was back in the comforts of my hotel, living the high life some more - they provide a Napa Valley wine tasting every evening... but still somewhat in between the dusty mirage of Black Rock City (most of my clothes still covered in a thick layer of dust) and the real world (I did have a wonderful shower, and was excited to be less than 24 hours away from being back home in Seattle). That evening, I went out to meet Eric and Kristine for dinner nearby&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TJXR1w5FD7I/AAAAAAAAJtQ/4HNuvd2W5qQ/s1600/eric.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 400px;&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_-HBt9Acp_lc/TJXR1w5FD7I/AAAAAAAAJtQ/4HNuvd2W5qQ/s400/eric.JPG&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5518547639999991730&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;And documented said encounter using the camera on my iPhone... which left quite a bit to be desired in terms of photo quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following morning, it was time to complete the last leg of the journey and fly back to Seattle... or so went the plan anyway. I examined my tickets again in the morning - they definitely said I was departing from the Oakland airport at 1 PM. I should arrive an hour early... I checked the BART schedules - it would take an hour to get there. I should also get some lunch beforehand - there''s this great little sushi boat restaurant just nearby in Union Square... mmm, sushi. Well, somewhere in the middle of all that, my mind clearly flipped back into Burning Man mode, where time doesn''t exist (and I avoided wearing a watch as much as I could) and an hour was lost. Because if your flight''s at 1, you should be at the airport 12, and so, you should get on the subway at 11. Instead, I scouted out a train schedule for leaving the city at 12 and settled in for lunch at 11... Lunch was delicious! And at 11:45, I arrived back in my room, stared at my ticket, then at the clock, then at the ticket some more... forced brain to do some basic math... Oh Fuck! Well, the subway/bus was going to get me there in an hour for about $7, time to see how a $70 taxi will do! I told the concierge I needed a taxi to the Oakland airport. He went outside, rounded up a taxi, and told the driver to take me to the airport... Note the slight discrepancy there... Starting to drive towards the San Francisco airport instead of Oakland cost another ten minutes, which I didn''t really have... Finally, we pulled up at the Oakland terminal at about 12:35. At least the ride was interesting - the driver had been in Vietnam during the war, as a civilian contractor and had fascinating stories from the time that he was getting published... He also complained about all the Pakistani cab drivers in the Bay Area... I chimed in complaining about the drivers in general all over India. We had a good rapport... and then I paid and took off on a dead run into the airport. Skipping the details, but I made my flight with, oh about 2 minutes to spare. How my bags managed to get onboard, I have no idea, but there they were looking at me on the carousel back in Seattle, just as I was asking the Southwest claims agent whether or not he thought they''d be on the next flight... So, all in all, disaster averted - delicious lunch eaten, interesting conversation with a cab driver had, and Seattle successfully reached! Just a bit of stress mixed in along the way...&lt;div class=&quot;blogger-post-footer&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=''1'' height=''1'' src=''https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2883997969551391628-3544962671544204260?l=safety3rd.blogspot.com'' alt='''' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;', NULL, NULL, 'Did I Say Done?', 'http%3A%2F%2Fsafety3rd.blogspot.com%2F2010%2F09%2Fdid-i-say-done.html', 1, 'Alex', NULL, 'San Francisco,Oakland', 3, NULL, NULL);

I hope you do because had you forgotten and tried to go back and look them up again on the blog over the last couple of weeks, you would''ve certainly found all of my writing, but not any of the pictures... (Thanks, Lott, for catching this!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the good news is last night, I went through and fixed everything, so the pictures are all back. I even tried to fix my spelling and grammar errors - I do tend to proof-read my posts, usually, but it seems I''m still not all that good at it. There is no bad news - everything is just back. There are some boring technical details, which you are welcome to skip, but I''ll type up anyway, just in case you care (and because it gives me a forum to bitch at the governments of Burma and China for their idiotic internet policies): Burma and China aren''t the types of countries that particularly encourage free and unfettered expression, such as blogging. They attempt to control it by using a standard, heavy-handed, Communist-style approach: you cannot access blogger.com or blogspot.com from a computer in China or Burma. As with most standard, heavy-handed, Communist-style approaches to solving problems that shouldn''t really be problems in the first place, the approach doesn''t work. I was obviously able to post from Burma and China - all because there''s a million proxy servers out there that computer users of China and Burma utilize to get around their respective governments'' idiotic restrictions. In Burma, the proxy would usually be already installed on most of the internet cafe machines... In China, they had wi-fi, so I got it on my laptop. There was, however, an issue - routing all your requests to blogger.com through a server in, say, Holland, made your [already slow] internet connection speeds that much slower, so I gave up on uploading pictures to blogger, putting them on my site instead, then simply referencing them from the blog. It actually took a bit of work to get the process all figured out, but pretty soon, I had it down to a science (which makes it kind of sad that I had to spend three hours undoing all of my cross-site magic last night). And this magical science worked great... all the way until last month, until I had to transfer the site from Arnie''s server to one of my own - a process which allowed us to discover that when you cancel your account with 1&amp;1 Hosting (whom I''m reluctant to recommend at this point, btw), they insist on hijacking your domain name for a month and using it to redirect traffic to one of the other sites they are being paid to host (and some nice man in Hyderabad, India will be powerless to do anything about it). This, naturally, means that all the images I had uploaded to my site from Burma and Tibet had now evaporated, so the blog posts that were pointing to them were now picture-less... So, that''s the annoying technical reasons - if you are unclear on what the hell I''m talking about (or even if you are), never fear - the photos on the blog are all back now! (Unless you are reading this on Facebook, which imports my blog posts, but doesn''t update the imported snapshots when I change them, so if you want to take the time to navigate their ineffective UI to get to some of the posts from last February, you will discover these elusive picture-less posts... But you shouldn''t do that! You either don''t care at all, in which case you should''ve stopped reading ten minutes ago, or you''ll just use the fairly intuitive navigation tools you get at &lt;a href=&quot;safety3rd.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;safety3rd.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as a reward for indulging me in my little rant, here''s a few of these ''recovered'' photographs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot;
